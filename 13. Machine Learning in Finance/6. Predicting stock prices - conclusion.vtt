In this lecture we are going to talk about the difference between technical and alliances and quantitative

00:07.220 --> 00:11.960
analysis so technical analysis is about historical data.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.060
This is what we have been talking about in this chapter.

00:15.080 --> 00:21.010
We use machine learning algorithms in order to approximate stock prices in the future.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.890
And we have come to the conclusion that it's not working that fine.

00:24.970 --> 00:31.610
And as far as I am concerned I'm a huge fan of quantitative analysis because it has an assumption all

00:31.610 --> 00:37.500
financial quantities such as stock prices or interest rates has random behavior.

00:37.520 --> 00:44.090
So we have to use randomness in our models stochastic calculus still has the differential equations

00:44.090 --> 00:44.900
are needed.

00:44.900 --> 00:51.830
This is why Blackshaw modalist so popular the complexity behind black shows model is able to grasp the

00:51.830 --> 00:56.020
fundamental randomness that's present in the stock market.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.990
So I'm not a huge fan of technical analysis.

00:59.120 --> 01:05.960
Historical data is not going to contain all the information needed to build a good model.

01:06.050 --> 01:11.980
And that's why machine learning approaches time series and alliances are not going to work that much.

01:12.020 --> 01:16.710
OK we have seen that with K-ET and KNUS neighbor classifier.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.290
We can achieve 61 percent accuracy which is not that bad.

01:21.470 --> 01:27.320
If you have lots of lots of money and you make lots of lots of trades maybe you are able to make money

01:27.320 --> 01:28.420
on the stock market.

01:28.520 --> 01:35.780
But if you may recall this accuracy is quite bad as far as for example optical character recognition

01:35.780 --> 01:37.160
is concern.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.010
Thanks for watching.
