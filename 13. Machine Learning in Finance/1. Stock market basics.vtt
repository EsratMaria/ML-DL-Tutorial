In this lecture we are going to talk about financial applications of machine learning.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.330
So we would like to predict stock prices in the future.

00:11.330 --> 00:14.450
So first of all what are stocks stocks or shares.

00:14.450 --> 00:17.760
Are the ownership of a small piece of a company.

00:17.900 --> 00:24.880
So if you have a good idea you can raise capital by selling off future profits in the form of shares.

00:24.890 --> 00:27.450
This is how most of the startups begin.

00:27.710 --> 00:28.560
OK.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.590
Why is it good to buy stocks.

00:30.620 --> 00:34.920
First of all because of dividends plus any growth in the stock's value.

00:34.940 --> 00:41.690
So if you expect that the stock will rise in value in the future then you maintain a long position.

00:41.750 --> 00:48.310
And if you believe the price of the stock will decrease in value then you will maintain a short position.

00:48.380 --> 00:52.510
That's the main difference between loan position and short position.

00:52.580 --> 00:58.690
OK so let's suppose the situation that we have the price of the stock this is the Ass t.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.480
And of course we have the time.

01:00.590 --> 01:03.280
Of course the price of the stock will fluctuate.

01:03.290 --> 01:09.830
It can be described by brownian motion or Havener process but this is why machine learning is good because

01:09.830 --> 01:11.830
we don't have to build a model.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.800
I mean we don't have to care about standard normal distributions.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.760
We don't have to care about black issues.

01:17.870 --> 01:24.920
And so while we just want to build a data set what does it mean that we have to construct features and

01:24.920 --> 01:26.450
a target variable.

01:26.570 --> 01:34.750
In this case in our implementation the features are going to be daily returns the daily return yesterday.

01:34.760 --> 01:42.700
This is the leg one leg two is the daily return two days ago X3 is the daily return at three days ago

01:42.700 --> 01:43.640
and so on.

01:43.760 --> 01:50.120
So we have the daily return two days ago one day ago and yesterday and we would like to make a prediction

01:50.260 --> 01:50.780
later.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.370
The stock price went up or went down.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.450
Of course it is historical data.

01:56.480 --> 02:03.230
So we know the direction in this case it is up what about the next one as you can see we have shifted

02:03.320 --> 02:09.710
the features once that to the right and we are going to take this item as the day return.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.090
Two days ago this is the daily return of one day ago.

02:13.130 --> 02:15.230
This is the daily return yesterday.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.000
What about that direction.

02:17.060 --> 02:24.460
Again it is up and this is how we can construct the data set as far as the daily returns are concerned.

02:24.590 --> 02:30.970
These are going to be the features and the direction which is going to be the target where I am.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.110
Why is it good.

02:32.120 --> 02:39.230
Because if we train our Mesrine learning algorithm on a data set like this then we can predict the stock

02:39.230 --> 02:40.230
price to morrow.

02:40.280 --> 02:48.080
If we have a lag one like 2 x 3 maybe we are able to approximate whether the stock price will increase

02:48.080 --> 02:50.590
in value or decrease in value.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.410
Okay this is what we are going to talk about.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.290
Thanks for watching.
