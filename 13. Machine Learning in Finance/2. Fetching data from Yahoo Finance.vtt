In this lecture we are going to talk about how to fetch data from Yahoo Finance.

00:06.920 --> 00:13.190
So you may pose the question that where they find you these financial related data for example was the

00:13.190 --> 00:14.650
price of apples.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.400
What's the price of IBM stock and so on.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.550
You can look it up on Yahoo Finance.

00:20.550 --> 00:28.520
So for example if we search for the Apple stock price as you can see there's a summary for Apple's stock.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.810
In this case the price of Apple's stock is approximately $160.

00:33.950 --> 00:38.610
If you click on historical data this is what we are going to download.

00:38.690 --> 00:44.960
As you can see you can download the data and we could import it with the help of Python but we are able

00:44.960 --> 00:51.760
to download it directly from Yahoo Finance and of course there are several paramita such as the open

00:51.760 --> 00:57.550
price high priced low price closing price and adjusted closing price.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.010
And of course the volume we are going to deal with adjusted closing price.

01:02.150 --> 01:07.220
So you may pose the question What is this adjusted closing price adjusted closing price.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.450
Has something to do with closing price.

01:09.560 --> 01:15.080
But it takes into account factors such as dividends stock later and so on.

01:15.170 --> 01:20.180
So that's why I adjusted close price is a more accurate reflection of the stock's value.

01:20.270 --> 01:27.460
And usually quantitative analysts using adjusted closing price instead of the standard closing price.

01:27.470 --> 01:31.410
So that's why we are going to use adjusted closing price as well.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.210
Okay.

01:32.270 --> 01:36.290
So downloading the data from Yahoo Finance it's quite easy.

01:36.290 --> 01:40.330
You just have to import that Pandurs they iterator data.

01:40.490 --> 01:45.490
We are going to use it as the web and we just have to call the data reader.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.530
We have to define the given stock.

01:47.630 --> 01:51.620
In this case it is the Apple store the data source is the Yahoo.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.170
Because we would like the fact that data from Yahoo Finance.

01:55.190 --> 02:02.470
We have to define a start date and end date and we are going to deal with adjusted closing price down

02:02.480 --> 02:05.480
we are going to calculate that daily returns.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.800
Basically the daily return is the stock price today minus the stock price yesterday.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.240
Divide by the stock price yesterday.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.810
OK we can move typified by a hundred.

02:15.830 --> 02:22.260
If we are after a percentage sometimes we use the logarithm of the daily returns instead of the actual

02:22.270 --> 02:24.880
price is because of normalization.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.900
Now we are going to talk about a standard daily returns.

02:28.970 --> 02:36.350
OK so we just have to calculate the daily return as the data and the data that shift to 1 minus 1 this

02:36.350 --> 02:37.880
is how we can calculate it.

02:37.910 --> 02:38.550
Okay.

02:38.660 --> 02:45.740
Then we are able to create a histogram in order to check whether the daily returns have some distribution

02:45.830 --> 02:46.760
or not.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.160
And if we run despite unswept.

02:49.260 --> 02:57.680
So the fact that the normal the assumption is that the daily returns have normal distribution.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.680
And as you can see it is very very similar to a normal distribution.

03:01.850 --> 03:07.210
Okay we are not interested in quantitative finance we are going to do Mesrine learning approaches.

03:07.370 --> 03:15.200
But most of the financial related models assume that the distribution of daily returns is approximately

03:15.290 --> 03:19.060
a normal distribution as you can see it is approximately normal.

03:19.070 --> 03:26.130
It doesn't matter what's important in our Spack that we can download the data from Yahoo Finance.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.020
With this line of code.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.150
So it is quite easy and quite convenient.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.970
This is what we are going to use in the coming lectures.

03:34.220 --> 03:35.060
Thanks for watching.
