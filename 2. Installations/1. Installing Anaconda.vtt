High in this video we are going to talk about how you will be able to run your Python scripts.

00:07.620 --> 00:14.730
And the first option that you can install several libraries if you have Python already installed on

00:14.730 --> 00:22.770
your system that is if you are going to use the sickie to learn we are going to use the CPI we are going

00:22.770 --> 00:29.760
to use non-prime we are going to use panderers we are going to use matplotlib and so on.

00:29.760 --> 00:37.050
So what I have found it that the most convenient way is to download the Anaconda and Annacone there

00:37.110 --> 00:43.350
is going to provide a console such as the Windows command line if you are in a Windows operating system

00:43.680 --> 00:51.070
and you can run your Python scripts as you do it for example on the standard Windows command line.

00:51.210 --> 00:57.750
But what's very important is that this anaconda contains all the important libraries I have been talking

00:57.750 --> 01:01.540
about the NUMP pie matplotlib sip pie and so on.

01:01.740 --> 01:09.900
And the problem I had encountered when I tried to install the CPI library for some reason I wasnt able

01:09.900 --> 01:11.170
to install it.

01:11.190 --> 01:18.080
So a much more convenient way is to download the Anaconda and you can do it without any problem.

01:18.090 --> 01:24.610
I would like to download the anaconda you have to search for it and download an account.

01:24.630 --> 01:31.560
Now you have to navigate through the site and you can download it for Windows for Mac and for Linux

01:31.560 --> 01:38.770
as out and after you click on the icons that it is going to be downloaded you have to install it.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.450
And basically you are able to search for the Anaconda command line as you can see the Anaconda prompt

01:45.690 --> 01:52.110
is going to be here and you are able to run your Python scripts without any problem.

01:52.350 --> 01:55.020
But feel free to use whatever you like.

01:55.050 --> 02:01.650
I mean there are lots of lots of integrated development environments for Python and whatsoever as far

02:01.650 --> 02:02.960
as I am concerned.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.290
I found this Annacone to be very very convenient to use.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.280
Thanks for watching.
