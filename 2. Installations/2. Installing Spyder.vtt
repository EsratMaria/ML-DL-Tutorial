In the previous lecture we have installed Anaconda.

00:04.950 --> 00:12.030
So if you search for Anaconda on Windows for example you will have this anaconda prompt which means

00:12.030 --> 00:20.120
that if you have a python file for example this linear regression that PI you are able to execute and

00:20.130 --> 00:22.650
run that given python file.

00:22.650 --> 00:29.430
But there is a much more convenient option because if you have installed Anaconda there's going to be

00:29.520 --> 00:33.300
an integrated development environment called Spider.

00:33.330 --> 00:39.830
So if you search for Spider as you can see it is a desktop application for Python.

00:39.870 --> 00:48.060
So if you click on Spyer it is going to open this ID and we are able to run a python code in a very

00:48.060 --> 00:49.630
very convenient manner.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.680
So for example I print out Hello Verd.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.720
We just have to say that and if we run it there's going to be a console as you can see.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.350
And here's the string Halvard.

01:01.470 --> 01:07.910
So we are going to use this spider because I guess there you will find it much more convenient.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.020
As far as I am concerned I like using the command prompt.

01:12.120 --> 01:19.710
So if I have a linear regression file I just use this anaconda program to a byte in the name of the

01:19.710 --> 01:27.770
file that by and it is going to do the same it is going to execute and run the python file and printout

01:27.810 --> 01:28.680
Halvard.

01:28.830 --> 01:35.650
So feel free to choose whatever you prefer whether you use the Anaconda prompt or you use Finder as

01:35.650 --> 01:38.080
the integrated development environment.

01:38.130 --> 01:39.440
It is up to you.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.520
Thanks for watching.
