00:01.740 --> 00:09.650
While in this lecture we are going to class third tacts and we are going to use that 20 news groups

00:09.690 --> 00:18.420
dataset is 20 news groups dataset is a collection of approximately 20000 newsgroup documents partitioned

00:18.450 --> 00:21.920
evenly across 20 different news groups.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.420
We have graphics related topics.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.810
We have Politiques related topics.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.070
We have science related topics.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.690
We have religion related topics and so on.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.700
So this is what we are after that we are going to have a given sentence or a given document or a given

00:38.700 --> 00:46.650
article and after the training operation we would like to be able to classify whether that given article

00:46.710 --> 00:51.140
is about politics or religion science and so on.

00:51.300 --> 00:55.570
So basically we just have to import that 20 news groups.

00:55.640 --> 01:02.970
Count vectorize or the TFI the transformer the mood in army or navy base classifiers and so on.

01:03.180 --> 01:06.690
So we are going to have just four categories.

01:06.750 --> 01:14.750
We are going to handle all these categories out at Hazm religion graphics science and so on.

01:14.790 --> 01:17.840
We have to Thach these 20 news groups.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.590
It's going to be the training data set.

01:20.700 --> 01:25.820
We are going to have the categories we have defined here and we would like to shuffle it.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.090
OK.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.260
We are able to print for example the first dataset.

01:31.290 --> 01:32.280
Let's try it.

01:32.280 --> 01:43.030
I would like to print out first 10 lines of the first data and what's going to be the label.

01:43.030 --> 01:50.220
So it's very important that this time it's going to be a supervised learning algorithm in the sense

01:50.280 --> 01:53.200
that we have the training labels as well.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.750
OK I'm going to get rid of these.

01:57.810 --> 02:07.530
I'm going to say that I guess that we need something like this at the beginning and at the end.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.320
So let's say that and let's run around with them as you can see.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.410
This is going to be the first tanlines.

02:16.470 --> 02:24.830
Does anyone know of a good way to convert if I am GPDA fires into laserjet format and so on.

02:24.840 --> 02:32.500
So it has something to do with graphics as you can see this is the label of the target is computer graphics.

02:32.550 --> 02:36.750
So this is the training data and this is the label accordingly.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.090
So we are going to have a data set like this.

02:40.130 --> 02:44.540
What about the second article in the dataset of that same weight.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.660
And let's run it.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.430
I'm going to clear the console.

02:49.650 --> 02:50.820
I have a problem.

02:50.850 --> 02:54.040
I hope some of the gurus kind of help me solve this problem.

02:54.160 --> 02:54.910
OK.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.610
This has something to do with computer graphics as well.

02:58.650 --> 03:03.040
I would like to print out the first certain lines of the article.

03:03.390 --> 03:10.050
Let's run it again as you can see that the article itself is this.

03:10.170 --> 03:15.040
So the background of the problem or rectangular rectangular mash in a U-V domain.

03:15.240 --> 03:15.660
OK.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.500
It has something to do with the graphics as well.

03:18.570 --> 03:22.560
So basically we have the training set and the labels.

03:22.560 --> 03:30.500
But instead of dealing with numerical values here we have articles strings tax and so on.

03:30.810 --> 03:35.110
So that's all about the training data and the labels.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.940
And what do we have to do.

03:36.990 --> 03:44.230
We could use the T.F. ID vectorize or directly but I would like to show you that that T.F. idea for

03:44.220 --> 03:50.860
vectorize is equal to the count vectorize or plus the T.F. IDF transformer.

03:51.030 --> 03:58.360
So here we use the Count vectorize are you just going to use tokenize And what does it mean that it's

03:58.380 --> 04:03.710
going to count the occurrence of every single word in the article.

04:03.720 --> 04:11.160
Basically it's going to end up with the documentor matrix for the first article second article and so

04:11.160 --> 04:13.310
on instead of sentences.

04:13.440 --> 04:19.080
Here we are dealing with concrete articles with lots of lots of sentences.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.030
But the result is the same that document to them a matrix.

04:23.160 --> 04:28.770
OK so we have discount vectorize or we use the training data data.

04:28.860 --> 04:36.630
The data is going to contain that tax as we have discussed and then we can use that DFI be not DFI the

04:36.630 --> 04:37.840
vectorize are.

04:37.890 --> 04:45.930
But this time we use the DFI B-F transformer that is going to transform the count vectorize or into

04:45.990 --> 04:48.050
DFI the yes work the riser.

04:48.050 --> 04:54.480
Basically this is what we have been discussing in a topical section that counting the clearance according

04:54.480 --> 05:01.110
to tokenized is not going to work fine because we should get rid of these birds that do not contain

05:01.470 --> 05:09.510
information and a better approach is that T.F. IDF term frequency Ivar's document frequency approach.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.860
So this is how we use it.

05:10.860 --> 05:19.350
We have the idea IDF transformer and we fit transform on the X train count which is basically a matrix

05:19.440 --> 05:27.340
which is going to store the counters that how many times the given Verd appear in a given article.

05:27.570 --> 05:35.400
OK so we have this T.F. IDF Matrix and we would like to make some prediction with that half of an algorithm

05:35.640 --> 05:42.410
this time we are not going to use Kamins clustering but we are going to use the Navy base classifier.

05:42.420 --> 05:48.130
That's why we fit the X-raying TFI the half way the training data target.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.730
It's very important that we are able to use Navy base.

05:51.810 --> 05:58.380
And we don't have to use K means clustering because in this case we have the target says about not just

05:58.380 --> 06:01.200
the data but we have the targets.

06:01.260 --> 06:07.360
So it's going to be a supervised learning algorithm when we are dealing with Kamins clustering.

06:07.440 --> 06:13.620
We are going to talk about how to closter articles with the help of Kamins clustering.

06:13.650 --> 06:17.100
It's going to be an unsupervised learning algorithm.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.890
We doubt that targets.

06:18.900 --> 06:24.670
But in this case we have the targets as of out so we can use naval base classifier.

06:24.900 --> 06:29.480
And we have some test data for example these sentences.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.550
This has nothing to do with church or religion.

06:32.610 --> 06:36.980
Of course it's going to belong to the religion cluster.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
What about this sentence.

06:39.090 --> 06:42.830
Software engineering is getting hotter and hotter nowadays.

06:43.050 --> 06:47.410
It's going to do something with computers or science.

06:47.580 --> 06:54.570
OK so we just have to transform that given sentences with the count vectorize or then we just have to

06:54.570 --> 07:03.140
use the TGF ideas transformer in order to transform the counter-act arise or into TFI diethyl values

07:03.420 --> 07:09.570
and then we can make some predictions with the help of the model What's the model the model is going

07:09.570 --> 07:13.770
to be the model constructed by DNA based classifier.

07:13.910 --> 07:14.390
Okay.

07:14.400 --> 07:20.630
And then we have to iterate through the document then the category and we just have to print at what's

07:20.640 --> 07:22.360
going to be the prediction.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.930
So let's save it and let's run it.

07:24.930 --> 07:32.850
I'm going to clear the console and if we run it it's going to make the prediction that it has something

07:32.850 --> 07:34.370
to do with religion.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.630
OK it is quite a good guess.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.280
What about the next sentence.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.630
The next article.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.300
It has something to do with computers.

07:42.330 --> 07:43.720
It is a good guess.

07:43.920 --> 07:51.630
So basically or not if basic classifier did a pretty good job after the training procedure because we

07:51.630 --> 08:00.210
had a huge dataset with 20000 articles we are able to make new predictions on the last data set.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.740
In this case we have two past sentences.

08:03.750 --> 08:09.330
This has nothing to do with church and religion and software engineering is getting hotter and hotter

08:09.360 --> 08:10.350
no days.

08:10.350 --> 08:17.370
And as you can see now you've base classifier makes a pretty good approximation that this sentence has

08:17.370 --> 08:19.270
something to do with religion.

08:19.410 --> 08:23.390
And this sentence has something to do with computer science.

08:23.510 --> 08:32.490
OK so what's very important that in this case these twenty news groups dataset has data as well as Target

08:32.550 --> 08:33.500
variables.

08:33.540 --> 08:40.140
So it's going to be a supervised learning algorithm when we are going to discuss clustering Gogg rhythms

08:40.140 --> 08:42.080
such as Kamins clustering.

08:42.210 --> 08:49.500
We are going to talk about how to deal with tax classification and natural language processing if we

08:49.500 --> 08:50.830
do not have the target.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.740
Where are you us.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.970
And usually this is the case we would like to build the Web.

08:56.030 --> 09:03.760
Crowder that's going to take a look at certain articles and going to make the classification and clustering

09:03.990 --> 09:10.950
without human intervention that we don't know the target the algorithm itself is going to come up with

09:10.950 --> 09:16.830
the given Klosters better it has something to do with religion whether it has something to do with computer

09:16.830 --> 09:17.850
science.

09:17.850 --> 09:22.470
But if we have the target we're able to we can use neither of these classifier.

09:22.470 --> 09:28.850
And basically this is how we make natural language processing and text classification with Navy base

09:28.870 --> 09:32.800
adrià them on the 20 news groups dataset.

09:32.820 --> 09:33.830
Thanks for watching.
