Okay in the last lecture we have been talking about the abstract mathematical model behind nave based

00:08.150 --> 00:11.910
classifier So let's see a concrete illustration.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.880
We have two classes.

00:13.970 --> 00:20.510
The yellow class and the green class with lots of lots of data samples as you can see and of course

00:20.510 --> 00:27.220
the aim is to be able to classify a new sample as you can see this dog with the question mark.

00:27.290 --> 00:33.710
The aim of the algorithm is to decide whether it's going to belong to the yellow class or to the green

00:33.710 --> 00:34.410
class.

00:34.610 --> 00:40.000
So first of all let's calculate the probabilities of the given classes.

00:40.090 --> 00:40.550
OK.

00:40.550 --> 00:42.920
So in this case we have two classes.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.760
Basically these are C K Klaas's K is equal to two.

00:47.750 --> 00:54.740
In this case because we have a green class and a yellow class so C one is the yellow class for example

00:54.800 --> 01:00.700
and C is the green class and the X parameters are the features.

01:00.770 --> 01:06.990
In this case we have two features because we are dealing with points on a two dimensional plane.

01:07.040 --> 01:15.330
So we have x1 and x2 features one for the X scored and at and the second for the y coordinate.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.670
OK so what's the probability of the yellow class.

01:18.770 --> 01:19.990
What do we have to do.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.550
We have to calculate the yellow dots.

01:22.670 --> 01:27.960
There are seven yellow dots and we have to calculate the dots all together.

01:27.980 --> 01:35.150
There are 17 dots which means that we have 17 data samples in the training data set.

01:35.270 --> 01:43.290
So basically it is the probability that if we pick a Daut at random it's going to have the color yellow.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.870
What about the green one.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.140
We have to calculate the green dots.

01:47.150 --> 01:54.550
There are 10 green dots and we have two divided by the number of samples which is 17.

01:54.560 --> 02:01.550
So it means the probability that if we pick a door at random its color is going to be green.

02:01.670 --> 02:06.790
OK so first of all we have to calculate the probabilities of the classes.

02:06.840 --> 02:14.300
Dan we have to consider the neighboring items and we have to calculate the probability that if we have

02:14.510 --> 02:21.220
this news sample who read all the neighboring items was the probability it's going to be green.

02:21.230 --> 02:29.520
There are three green dots within the neighborhood and how many green dots are there all together.

02:29.600 --> 02:35.210
So three dots in the neighborhood and all together we have 10 green dots.

02:35.270 --> 02:37.930
We have to do the same for the yellow dots.

02:37.970 --> 02:44.560
There's just a single yellow dot in the neighborhood and how many yellow dots are there all together.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.060
One two three four five six seven.

02:47.120 --> 02:54.590
So that's why we divide by seven and if we want to calculate the probability that the new sample belongs

02:54.590 --> 03:01.880
to the Greenglass we just have to multiply the probability of the green class by the probability that

03:01.880 --> 03:04.780
the new sample belongs to the green class.

03:04.910 --> 03:08.800
OK 10 divide by 17 times three.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.180
Divide by 10.

03:10.250 --> 03:14.610
It is ECOs 230 divided by 170.

03:14.630 --> 03:21.500
What about the probability that the new sample belongs to the yellow Clauss is a probability of the

03:21.500 --> 03:28.580
yellow class times the probability that the new sample belongs to the yellow class based on the neighboring

03:28.640 --> 03:37.370
items 7 divide by 17 times 1 divide by 7 which is equal to 7 divide by one hundred and nineteen.

03:37.490 --> 03:41.050
OK so we have calculated these values.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.760
What do we have to do now.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.660
Based classifier is going to choose the S.K. class with the highest probability.

03:48.770 --> 03:56.090
OK so the highest value is Surt they divided by one hundred and seventy which means that the new sample

03:56.360 --> 04:01.100
according to the knave based classifier belongs to the green class.

04:01.100 --> 04:08.250
So as far as regression problems are concerned we have defined the optimal be Peramivir is real.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.920
Gradient descent or maximum likelihood estimator.

04:12.050 --> 04:19.910
Here For now the base classifier we are dealing with probabilities and basically fitting the model means

04:19.910 --> 04:27.360
finding the given probabilities in order to be able to classify new samples such as in this case.

04:27.530 --> 04:31.000
OK so this is how naive basic classifier works.

04:31.190 --> 04:32.080
Thanks for watching.
