00:01.630 --> 00:08.860
Let's talk a bit about gynie index approach so far we have been talking about how to construct a decision

00:08.860 --> 00:12.710
tree with the help of entropy and information gain.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.970
There are lots of lots of other approaches such as this genie index approach.

00:18.070 --> 00:25.600
OK this is the so-called cart algorithm which stands for classification and a regression tree algorithm

00:25.930 --> 00:32.630
and this algorithm uses GINI index to decide how to make displayed for a given decision tree.

00:32.740 --> 00:39.400
So using Gini Index approach is a bit better than calculating the information again and entropy because

00:39.400 --> 00:46.610
when dealing with entropy we have to calculate logarithmic functions which are computationally expensive.

00:46.750 --> 00:52.900
So that's why we prefer Gini Index approach because it is a bit faster algorithm.

00:52.960 --> 01:01.150
OK so if you may recall when calculating the Shannon entropy we have to deal with this formula the probability

01:01.180 --> 01:08.470
times the logarithm of the probability and calculating the logarithm function is quite expensive.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.560
That's why we pay for this genie index approach.

01:11.680 --> 01:18.220
But what extremely important that the two algorithms are approximately the same they are calculating

01:18.220 --> 01:26.800
the same values Gini Index approach does not rely heavily on entropy and it is the huge advantage for

01:26.800 --> 01:32.820
this approach because calculating the logarithm functions are computationally expensive.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.210
OK so we just have to deal with this formula.

01:36.220 --> 01:41.620
The genie index is ECOs to want a minus the sum of the probabilities.

01:41.650 --> 01:45.590
We just have to sum up the probabilities for every single class.

01:45.730 --> 01:54.370
So N is the number of our good classes for credit scoring D and easy close to because the output value

01:54.370 --> 01:56.180
can be 0 or 1.

01:56.200 --> 02:02.890
The client has the false data or the client is able to pay back the loan when dealing with the IRS data

02:02.890 --> 02:05.140
set and is ECOs Destry.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.700
I always said Tozer.

02:06.730 --> 02:12.410
Iris versicolor and Iris virginica as far as the output losses are concerned.

02:12.550 --> 02:21.130
OK so after calculating the G x GINI index values we just have to use this formula in order to calculate

02:21.130 --> 02:24.570
the E values and we split the feature.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.890
We the law was GINI index.

02:26.890 --> 02:32.460
So we search for the lowest eveil you and that's the feature we have displayed.

02:32.530 --> 02:36.610
So it is very very similar to the information again approach.

02:36.640 --> 02:43.960
Here we are not going to deal with Shannon entropy but we are going to deal with this formula when calculating

02:43.960 --> 02:45.210
the genie index.

02:45.300 --> 02:45.760
OK.

02:45.760 --> 02:52.420
So for example we are able to calculate the genie index for a given target voluble as far as playing

02:52.420 --> 02:53.800
golf is concerned.

02:53.950 --> 02:59.180
Nine times the output value is yes four five times it is no.

02:59.320 --> 03:07.600
So the djinni index is going to be one minus the probability of yes square and minus the probability

03:07.660 --> 03:09.700
of no square.

03:09.790 --> 03:17.390
This is what we have been discussing this is the formula 1 minus the sum of the X sobeit Square.

03:17.410 --> 03:22.020
So here we have two output classes yes or no.

03:22.060 --> 03:24.520
The probability of Yes is nine.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.330
Divide by 14 which is 0.60 4.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.720
We have to square it minus the probability of no which is 5 divided by 14.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.390
0.30 6 squared.

03:37.390 --> 03:40.790
And the final result is zero dot 46.

03:40.940 --> 03:45.560
OK so this is how we calculate the index for a given target voluble.

03:45.640 --> 03:52.320
But of course we have to calculate these eveil you in order to know what features to split.

03:52.330 --> 04:00.250
So if we have a gender that can be male or female and for example we are dealing with the credit scoring

04:00.260 --> 04:01.190
dataset.

04:01.210 --> 04:09.280
So the target variable is 0 or 1 whether the client has the false data or the client is able to pay

04:09.280 --> 04:10.230
back the loan.

04:10.330 --> 04:19.420
As far as males are concerned there are three yes values in the target variable and two no values as

04:19.420 --> 04:21.760
far as females are concerned.

04:21.910 --> 04:26.190
There are four yes values and zero no values.

04:26.200 --> 04:32.500
First of all we have to calculate the genie index as far as the target of triable is concerned which

04:32.500 --> 04:33.770
is the default.

04:33.790 --> 04:41.830
So one minus the probability of yes which is seven because we have a sweep loss for yeses and we have

04:41.830 --> 04:44.380
to divide it by all the answers.

04:44.560 --> 04:50.530
So we have seven yes values to no values seven plus two is nine.

04:50.530 --> 04:52.900
That's why we have to divide it by nine.

04:53.020 --> 05:00.610
So this is the probability that the default value is yes we have to square it minus the probability

05:00.610 --> 05:04.790
that default value is no it is to divide by 9.

05:04.860 --> 05:09.720
And of course we have to square it because this is the formula we are using.

05:09.780 --> 05:18.860
All is ECOs to 0.30 for Dan who we have to calculate the genie indices as far as the splits are concerned.

05:18.930 --> 05:24.450
So first of all we have to calculate the genie indices for the given braunches.

05:24.540 --> 05:32.430
So the gender feature can be splitted into a male branch and the female branch the genie index for the

05:32.430 --> 05:41.370
male branch is the one minus the probability of yes in that given branch stree divide by 5 3 because

05:41.370 --> 05:45.470
we have three yes values as far as male is concerned.

05:45.610 --> 05:54.220
And there is three plasty values as far as all the values are concerned for male 2:03.

05:54.240 --> 06:00.050
So that's why we divide by 5 squared minus the probability of no.

06:00.060 --> 06:07.840
For males it is to divide by all the values for male which is to divide by five square.

06:08.010 --> 06:10.070
This is the genie index for male.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.770
Then we have to calculate the same for the other branch.

06:13.770 --> 06:17.270
So that gender can be split into male and female.

06:17.310 --> 06:22.760
So the genie index of female is 1 minus the probability of yes.

06:22.770 --> 06:28.370
For females for divide by four square and minus the probability of no.

06:28.380 --> 06:33.780
For a female 0 divided by four square it is equal to zero.

06:33.780 --> 06:39.940
This is how we calculate the genie in this says and we have multiplied by the probabilities.

06:40.080 --> 06:48.770
So that's why the final evil is going to be equal to the G.T. which is the genie index of default.

06:48.780 --> 06:54.070
This is what we have already calculated so it is approximately 0.30 for.

06:54.150 --> 07:00.420
So 0.30 for minors the probability of male was the probability of male.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.280
It is three plus two.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.010
So that's why five divided by nine.

07:05.010 --> 07:10.830
Because there are nine samples no matter that the person is male or female.

07:10.890 --> 07:14.830
2:03 plus four plus 0 is equal to 9.

07:14.850 --> 07:20.540
So 5 divided by 9 is the probability that a given person is male.

07:20.550 --> 07:29.490
Times the genie index of male which is 0.30 for again minus the probability that the given person is

07:29.490 --> 07:30.390
female.

07:30.420 --> 07:36.330
It is for the white by nine times the genie index of gender female.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.880
OK which is zero.

07:37.890 --> 07:42.060
That's why the final e value is 0.15.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.410
Ok sorry for that.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.070
I have managed to miscalculate almost every single values.

07:47.250 --> 07:54.750
So as far as the genie index of the male is concerned it is equal to zero or 48 as far as the genie

07:54.750 --> 07:58.050
index of female is concerned it is zero.

07:58.170 --> 08:07.140
And as far as the evil you is concerned it is the G where T is the target of triable it is 0.30 for

08:07.200 --> 08:13.680
OK minus 5 divided by non-meat is the probability that the gender is male times.

08:13.770 --> 08:20.880
The genie index of male minors the probability of female times the genie index of female.

08:20.910 --> 08:25.820
So the final result for the evil you is 0 0 7.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.930
Sorry for the inconvenience.

08:27.930 --> 08:35.220
We just have to calculate this event for all the features and we split the feature away.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.230
No worse GINI index.

08:37.260 --> 08:44.010
So this is how we can calculate the index and we just have to select the lowest one in order to decide

08:44.070 --> 08:46.070
what feature to split.

08:46.140 --> 08:52.710
OK and by the way the implementation is quite easy because we just have to define the criteria and is

08:52.710 --> 08:58.050
not going to be the entropy but it is going to be the genie index approach.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.570
So if we save it and run it.

09:00.720 --> 09:06.110
I guess that the accuracy is going to be approximately the same as you can see.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.150
This is the cross validated result.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.060
Approximately 95 percent accuracy.

09:11.070 --> 09:18.100
This is the accuracy as far as splitting the dataset into training data set and test data set.

09:18.270 --> 09:25.020
So this is how we can use decision tree classifiers with the help of entropy and with the help of the

09:25.020 --> 09:31.730
Genie index approach we prefer the genie index approach because it is a faster algorithm.

09:31.740 --> 09:37.890
There's no need to calculate the logarithm of the probability when dealing with the Shannon entropy.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.250
This is why the genie index approach is preferred.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.120
Thanks for watching.
