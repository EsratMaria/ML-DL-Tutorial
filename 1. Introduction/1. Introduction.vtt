00:00.270 --> 00:03.520
Hi my name is Balazs alter from Budapest Hungary.

00:03.630 --> 00:06.110
And welcome to my course on machine learning.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.490
And now we're all networks in Python.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.960
So first of all let me tell a few words about myself.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.520
I'm from Budapest Hungary.

00:13.650 --> 00:20.010
I'm qualified as a physicist and later on I decided to get a master's degree in applied mathematics.

00:20.010 --> 00:26.740
Currently I'm working as a software engineer and I'm interested in algorithms and artificial intelligence.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.300
So what you are going to get from this course we are going to talk about three main topics machine learning

00:33.600 --> 00:38.740
computer vision and now we're on networks as far as machine learning is concerned.

00:38.820 --> 00:46.080
We are going to talk about most of the relevant approaches such as regression nearest neighbor classifier

00:46.320 --> 00:53.520
name based classifier support vector machines bagging and boosting and clustering algorithms.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.640
We are going to talk about a theoretical background and we are going to implement give him problems

00:59.880 --> 01:02.280
with the help of Python libraries.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.030
The next topic is about computer vision.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.780
We are going to talk about Viola Jones algorithm for object detection.

01:09.780 --> 01:16.320
We are going to talk about phase detection and we will use Open see the library in order to achieve

01:16.320 --> 01:17.520
this objective.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.330
The last topic is now we're all networks and deep learning.

01:21.420 --> 01:26.620
So we are going to talk about feet for Verdon were all networks deep our own networks.

01:26.670 --> 01:30.660
Convolutional Now what role networks and recurrent neural networks.

01:30.730 --> 01:37.320
Again we are going to talk about a technical background and then we are going to implement these problems

01:37.620 --> 01:43.440
with the help of carers and with the help of Google's open source dance or flow framework.

01:43.620 --> 01:47.360
What's very important that there is an HD option for the lectures.

01:47.460 --> 01:53.490
So if you find your videos blurry you just have to set it to an HD option like you do it on YouTube

01:53.490 --> 01:54.510
for example.

01:54.570 --> 01:57.220
Thanks for joining my corps lads get started.
