00:00.780 --> 00:07.680
High in this video we are going to take a look at how to construct a feat for about an hour of network.

00:07.860 --> 00:14.840
So let's import that by brain structure feedforward not work linearly or see more Edley or bias unit

00:15.150 --> 00:16.800
and a full connection.

00:16.800 --> 00:23.160
So we are able to create a feed for about an hour on that front and we are able to specify the building

00:23.160 --> 00:28.380
blocks the structure basically a linear layer or sigmoid layer by this unit.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.260
We are able to create connections between the layers and so on.

00:33.300 --> 00:39.160
So we are able to instantiate that for is equal to a feedforward network.

00:39.270 --> 00:48.360
And we can specify the input layer for example so the input layer is equal to linearly or it's going

00:48.360 --> 00:57.750
to have to now loans in the input layer then we will have a hidden layer is equal to sigmoid layer with

00:57.840 --> 01:04.340
3 now roans and the output layer is equal to the sigmoid layer.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.920
Again we want output now wrong.

01:06.950 --> 01:07.670
OK.

01:07.860 --> 01:13.260
This is what we have been discussing in that article section basically that the first layer of the input

01:13.260 --> 01:19.380
layer basically doesnt have any activation function it is the linear layer of the linear layer is not

01:19.380 --> 01:21.650
going to transform the import.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.060
This is what we are looking for the sigmoid layer is going to use the sigmoid function to calculate

01:27.060 --> 01:29.490
the final activations.

01:29.760 --> 01:38.310
OK and then we can see that network on module and before are in the module I would like to create the

01:38.310 --> 01:40.840
bypass for the input layer.

01:40.860 --> 01:49.350
It is equal to a bias unit and I would like to create the second the bias unit so bias Unit 2 and I

01:49.350 --> 01:53.460
would like to Aude First of all the bias units

01:56.020 --> 01:57.060
are module.

01:57.080 --> 02:04.310
I would like to order by S2 and then I would like two or two later.

02:04.330 --> 02:09.470
So I would like to charge the input layer.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.230
I'm going to copy and paste that.

02:12.310 --> 02:15.550
So I would like to order a hidden layer

02:18.400 --> 02:20.840
and the output layer.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.480
Okay.

02:22.900 --> 02:28.690
And then I would like to create the connections between the input layer and the hidden layer and between

02:28.690 --> 02:30.950
the hidden layer and the output layer.

02:31.150 --> 02:36.530
And because every now and its connected to every single that were on we can use the full connection

02:38.140 --> 02:47.080
so input and hidden the connections between the input and the hidden layer is equal to full and action

02:47.440 --> 02:55.760
and we can find that it's going to be between the input layer and the hidden layer.

02:55.870 --> 03:06.760
Then I would like to create hidden output is going to be a food connection between the hidden layer

03:07.150 --> 03:10.460
and the output layer.

03:10.570 --> 03:19.000
We would like to create the connections between the bias nodes and now roans so pious and I would like

03:19.000 --> 03:32.110
to create full connection between bias wanted and hidden layer than bias to output is equal to a food

03:32.110 --> 03:33.130
connection.

03:33.130 --> 03:38.970
And this is how we create connections between the second bias now and the output layer.

03:39.310 --> 03:44.400
And then we just have to call the network Daut sort modules.

03:44.470 --> 03:48.460
And basically this is how we initialize the network.

03:48.610 --> 03:52.490
For example the modules are Sautee topologically and so on.

03:52.660 --> 04:01.020
So sort modules and we are able to printout the network south.

04:01.180 --> 04:05.150
So if I say that I think there's not going to be any typos.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.740
But let's see instead of network 1 I printouts network 2.

04:10.870 --> 04:16.760
And as you can see we have a feed forward in our network okay and we have a bias need.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.250
We have another bias you need.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.030
We have a linear input layer.

04:20.050 --> 04:24.810
We have a sigmoid hidden layer and we have a c Moeed output layer.

04:24.850 --> 04:31.270
We have the connections and so on and if we would like to get more information then we are able to print

04:31.270 --> 04:39.670
out for example the way to alies between the input layer and the hidden layer for example so input hidden

04:39.940 --> 04:41.240
that operands.

04:41.260 --> 04:48.640
And if we say that it's going to printout that it's going to print out the connections as you can see

04:48.970 --> 04:52.600
we have one two three four five six.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.570
Yeah because we have to input.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.670
Now one owns and three he didn't want.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.950
So that's why we have six connections.

04:58.960 --> 05:03.090
Basically the DS randomly initialized educates.

05:03.250 --> 05:10.040
If we are curious that what's going to be the educates between the bias and the hidden layer.

05:10.090 --> 05:13.630
Of course there's going to be sorry actuates.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.790
So let's see if I run it again.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.020
Yeah sorry actuates.

05:17.020 --> 05:26.860
Between the buyer Snoad and sigmoid layer are three named roans OK that I would like to get educated

05:26.950 --> 05:30.850
between the hidden layer and the output layer.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.690
I'm going to clear the console.

05:33.700 --> 05:40.480
And yeah there's going to be Street values because we have three edges between the he didn't layer and

05:40.480 --> 05:41.760
the output layer.

05:41.890 --> 05:48.090
So this is how you can construct modules fuel connections bias units and so on.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.510
In order to construct the feedforward and our own network.

05:51.790 --> 05:52.910
Thanks for watching.
