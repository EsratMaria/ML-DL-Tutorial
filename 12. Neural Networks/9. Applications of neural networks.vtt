High in this video let me tell a few words about the concrete applications of natural networks.

00:08.220 --> 00:14.790
We have been talking about that it's very very important to know that we don't have to use natural networks

00:14.970 --> 00:22.830
for problems that can be solved by well-defined algorithms for example numerical methods for example

00:22.890 --> 00:27.520
RSA encoding for example shortest path algorithms and so on.

00:27.660 --> 00:34.440
And there are well-defined deterministic algorithms for these kinds of problems but there are other

00:34.440 --> 00:38.160
problems that cannot be solved so easily.

00:38.160 --> 00:45.760
For example self-driving cars plus cars that are able to park themselves without human intervention.

00:45.930 --> 00:50.710
There is no predefined algorithm for doing something like this.

00:50.850 --> 00:58.620
And now our own network is able to learn how to be able to drive a car how to be able to park themselves

00:58.650 --> 00:59.680
and so warm.

00:59.970 --> 01:03.880
Or for example pattern recognition in the health care industry.

01:03.990 --> 01:08.540
It can detect cancer or IDs orders well in advance.

01:08.640 --> 01:15.670
It can be used for pattern detection in stock markets in order to predict stock prices.

01:15.690 --> 01:20.640
It can be used for facial recognition or natural language processing.

01:20.830 --> 01:27.300
And I think it's quite interesting to know that in the United Arab Emirates artificial intelligence

01:27.300 --> 01:29.770
has been used to control traffic.

01:29.790 --> 01:35.380
So our system has been created that intelligently calculates traffic mishaps.

01:35.380 --> 01:39.230
We are constantly finding solutions to fix them.

01:39.570 --> 01:46.970
So there may be several situations where a learning system we are now on network can prove to be very

01:47.040 --> 01:48.210
very important.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.810
Self-driving cars.

01:49.900 --> 01:56.700
Natural Language Processing optical correct or recognition or control of traffic in the United Arab

01:56.790 --> 01:57.800
Emirates.

01:58.050 --> 02:04.210
We are going to talk a lot more about the concrete applications when we are going to implement them.

02:04.260 --> 02:11.750
This video I just wanted to show you an overview that what are the applications of now networks banks

02:11.750 --> 02:12.620
are watching.
