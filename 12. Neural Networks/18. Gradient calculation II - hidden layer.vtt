00:00.780 --> 00:06.550
So far we have seen how to calculate the data for the output node.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.210
Why is it important to calculate the data.

00:09.240 --> 00:16.110
Because if we can calculate the gradient and we can decide that how much we should adjust the actuates

00:16.290 --> 00:24.930
for the national network as you can see we have a completely different equation that in order to be

00:24.930 --> 00:28.490
able to calculate the data for the hidden layer.

00:28.650 --> 00:34.260
It's going to be equal minus the derivative of the sigmoid function.

00:34.470 --> 00:42.390
And of course we have to apply it for the some times the sum of the weights and previously are doubters.

00:42.630 --> 00:49.410
So because we have a previously or data because this is the output layer we have already calculated

00:49.410 --> 00:49.850
it.

00:50.010 --> 00:57.320
And if we want to calculate this node data or data output as we call it for this given now we're on

00:57.540 --> 00:59.680
we just have to use this equation.

00:59.820 --> 01:00.400
Okay.

01:00.480 --> 01:06.300
As I said earlier sometimes this negative value is here sometimes it can be mated.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.880
It depends on how we define the errors.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.960
Okay.

01:10.230 --> 01:17.120
So in this case the data for this node is equal to the derivative of the sigmoid function.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.270
Was it a sum.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.370
We have already calculated it because we have the input.

01:21.370 --> 01:23.020
Now we don't basically.

01:23.180 --> 01:28.960
And we have already calculated that that was the Sarmad for this given node that suppose that it is

01:28.980 --> 01:30.980
minus 0.50 one.

01:31.240 --> 01:41.340
OK times we have to sum up all the educates and no doubt us going to the next Slayer because we have

01:41.340 --> 01:42.880
just a single edge.

01:42.900 --> 01:52.520
This is why we can say that we have to multiply the educate minus 0.2 to two times that previously your

01:52.590 --> 02:02.580
data which is zero darte 1 to 2 and it's going to be equal to 0.00 6 is going to be the data for these

02:02.610 --> 02:04.130
given now Rawn.

02:04.380 --> 02:11.760
And we have to calculate it for all that now owns except for the buyers Snoad and except for the input

02:11.760 --> 02:13.160
nodes.

02:13.170 --> 02:21.600
So again we have a different equation for the output layer data but after we have calculated it we can

02:21.600 --> 02:27.200
use this equation for calculating the hidden layers data.

02:27.270 --> 02:31.140
We just have to use that derivative of the sigmoid function.

02:31.140 --> 02:38.160
This is why I said that we definitely need that derivative of the activation function when we would

02:38.160 --> 02:40.490
like to train now and that of Europe.

02:40.650 --> 02:48.060
We are not able to use an activation function that doesn't have any derivative because we do need the

02:48.060 --> 02:50.550
derivative of the activation function.

02:50.550 --> 02:55.240
When we calculate that data is because this is how we calculate the gradient.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.340
And this is how we use back propagation by the way.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.170
So this is how we calculate the data.

03:01.440 --> 03:08.300
Okay what's important that we don't have to calculate the no data for the bias nodes and impot nodes.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.090
And why do we need it.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.100
We need no data.

03:12.150 --> 03:17.050
In order to calculate this basically this is the gradient.

03:17.190 --> 03:25.470
So the deliberative of the cost function or the mean square error with respect to the W adulate is going

03:25.470 --> 03:28.980
to be equal to the delta times the import.

03:29.040 --> 03:36.310
So this is the no data at the output node and this input is the activation of the now on import.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.570
Why is it good.

03:37.680 --> 03:44.000
Because we can use this equation when we are dealing with back propagation in the next video.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.860
We are going to take a look at back propagation.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.170
Thanks for watching.
