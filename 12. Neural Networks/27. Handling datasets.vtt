High in this video we are going to talk about how to handle data SATs in PI brain.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.020
So that's important.

00:08.040 --> 00:12.010
PI abrain dataset supervised data set.

00:12.180 --> 00:17.840
And if we would like to create a supervised data set it's quite easy we just have to instantiate it

00:18.060 --> 00:19.640
supervised data.

00:19.860 --> 00:27.420
And we have to specify that what's the number of the inputs and how many outputs we are looking for.

00:27.420 --> 00:34.920
So for example if we are talking about logical operators we had two inputs and a single output.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.730
Why.

00:35.730 --> 00:46.560
Because we have for example 0 0 as an input and we have zero as an output or if we have 1 0 then the

00:46.560 --> 00:51.830
output will be one for the X or logical relation.

00:52.020 --> 00:58.170
So that's why we have to specify that what's going to be the input size and the output size.

00:58.860 --> 01:08.510
And then we are able to order samples so our sample with 0 0 and for example 0.

01:08.590 --> 01:19.080
OK it's going to be the first sample then we are able to or I'm going to talk about X or logical relations

01:19.080 --> 01:23.550
so something like this like that.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.310
OK.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.030
And we are able to get that input.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.220
So we are able to get the inputs from this data.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.290
And we are able to get the target verifiable.

01:34.470 --> 01:42.140
So we are able to iterate through we have the input we have a target in the data.

01:42.390 --> 01:49.200
We just have to iterate through something like this and printout that the improved aim

01:52.220 --> 01:59.580
and output is the target solely for that the target for arrivals.

01:59.930 --> 02:06.120
So that say that and I guess we're just going to work fine.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.170
I'm going to run an hour on that story that by.

02:09.260 --> 02:16.520
And yet we are able to separate and gather the inputs and the targets from the Superlight data sat as

02:16.520 --> 02:23.960
you can see we have the input and the output input output input output on a line by line basis and we

02:23.960 --> 02:33.520
are able to if we would like to get for example all the inputs we can refer to the inputs as the input.

02:33.530 --> 02:41.810
So if we printed out like this going to say that cleared the console and run it as you can see we are

02:41.810 --> 02:49.460
able to get all of the input variables if we reference the data with this import and it's going to get

02:49.520 --> 02:52.350
all the rows for the inputs.

02:52.430 --> 02:59.030
If we are curious about the outputs or the target variables we just have to say that I would like to

02:59.090 --> 03:03.460
get from the data that targets.

03:03.830 --> 03:12.740
OK and if I say that and right again as you can see we are able to separate the inputs and the target

03:12.830 --> 03:13.930
accordingly.

03:14.120 --> 03:19.760
So this is how we handle data in PI brain quite easy and quite convenient.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.720
Thanks for watching.
