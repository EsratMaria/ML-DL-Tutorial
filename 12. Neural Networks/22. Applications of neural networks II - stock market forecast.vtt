High in this video we are going to talk about another application for now on networks and this is how

00:07.860 --> 00:10.830
to forecast stock market basically.

00:11.070 --> 00:18.330
So let's suppose the situation where we have a plot like this we have a given stalk and we monitored

00:18.330 --> 00:22.220
the price of that given stock in the range of time.

00:22.470 --> 00:22.950
OK.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.300
And of course it's kind of a stochastic process.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.420
I'm not sure whether you were familiar with.

00:28.500 --> 00:34.950
So has Dick process's it all integral power to solve still has the differential equations and something

00:34.950 --> 00:35.510
like that.

00:35.550 --> 00:36.630
What ever.

00:36.630 --> 00:43.110
Basically now the networks approach has nothing to do with these kinds of mathematical models because

00:43.110 --> 00:51.330
we try to find a pattern within a stock market data we drop off on our own network we drop a learning

00:51.330 --> 00:52.810
algorithm basically.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.900
And what's the intuition that we construct the training data.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.020
For example three data points.

01:00.050 --> 01:04.150
OK it can be four five 10 or 100 or whatever.

01:04.170 --> 01:08.970
In this example we use three data points plus the next one.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.840
And if we want to make prediction if we have three points what will be the stock price tomorrow for

01:15.840 --> 01:16.980
example.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.120
So let's create that data.

01:19.140 --> 01:27.270
Basically the training data that we have the first price second prize cert price and then we have their

01:27.270 --> 01:28.500
production.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.220
This is the first price.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.580
This is the second price.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.050
This is a surprise.

01:33.150 --> 01:40.920
And if we know that we have this surprise the surprise and the surprise was the next price we know for

01:40.920 --> 01:43.450
certain this is the historical data.

01:43.470 --> 01:51.420
So we have this Plaut we know for certain that these capital P one is going to be the price here.

01:51.420 --> 01:58.560
If we have these three previous prices what's going to be the second line in the training data.

01:58.710 --> 02:06.490
Basically the next two on this one we know days and days we just have to get these data from the plot.

02:06.630 --> 02:07.890
And what's the next step.

02:07.890 --> 02:11.030
It's going to be the production team and so on.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.300
Next one next one next one what's the price here.

02:15.300 --> 02:23.370
If we have these as the previous prices of course as you make gas it is quite redundant in the sense

02:23.370 --> 02:28.740
that this we want to is the same as DSP P2 on.

02:28.950 --> 02:34.340
And this the one sorry is the same as this P2 2.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.270
Okay.

02:35.460 --> 02:41.670
Because this is how we construct or data set and what is it good because if we have lots of lots of

02:41.670 --> 02:48.510
data like this we trained and out of network in this case you may guess that we have street input now

02:48.570 --> 02:57.390
owns 1 to 3 and we have a single output now and on and now and that work is going to learn that if this

02:57.390 --> 03:00.890
was the price and this and this this is the output.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.960
If it was the price this and this then this was the old wood and so on.

03:06.060 --> 03:11.870
Why is it good because maybe we are able to train our now and that to work on these data set.

03:12.030 --> 03:19.130
And if we provide an x y Zad three previous values it may predicate the stock price tomorrow.

03:19.180 --> 03:19.970
OK.

03:20.010 --> 03:27.170
So this is how we can construct an algorithm now and that we're basically for stock markets.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.160
Of course it is not that simple.

03:29.220 --> 03:33.060
If you do something like this it's not going to work that fine.

03:33.060 --> 03:40.950
I have tried it several times and lots of lots of stock market related algorithms relies heavily on

03:40.950 --> 03:48.150
our networks but we have to find other stocks for example and measure the correlation between the two

03:48.150 --> 03:48.840
of them.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.150
And basically we have to use.

03:51.160 --> 03:56.010
And now we're on a network to learn other features and other para meters.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.100
Concerning the stock market.

03:58.200 --> 04:04.260
But I think it is very very good example of how we can use in their role in that work and it is quite

04:04.260 --> 04:09.110
interesting as far as I am concerned this is one of my favorites.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.230
Thanks for watching.
