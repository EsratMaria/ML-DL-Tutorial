00:00.390 --> 00:08.850
OK we have been talking about the concrete models with the input values educates some function and then

00:08.850 --> 00:11.870
the activation functions in the previous lecture.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.430
So let's see a concrete example.

00:14.430 --> 00:17.480
So let's suppose that we have for example three input.

00:17.490 --> 00:24.540
Now roans of course with three values for example 1 1 and 0.

00:24.540 --> 00:28.380
These are going to be the input values for this.

00:28.380 --> 00:36.090
Now we're on this now we're on and this now we're on we have been talking about that every single edge.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.330
We have an agile way.

00:37.380 --> 00:43.790
Well you 0.2 minus 0.5 and 0.4.

00:44.160 --> 00:51.990
We have the SUM function and the activation function that we go when to calculate the output for this

00:52.020 --> 00:53.450
given now on.

00:53.850 --> 01:01.880
What about the sum the SUM function is going to take all the inputs multiplied by the edge weight.

01:02.040 --> 01:10.790
So X1 times w 1 plus the second input times the second adulate plus x 2 times W2.

01:11.010 --> 01:14.170
And we have the last input with the last educate.

01:14.310 --> 01:20.310
So plus x three times W3 it's equal to warn times.

01:20.320 --> 01:31.400
0.2 OK plus 1 times minus 0.5 OK and is zero times 0.4.

01:31.440 --> 01:38.930
OK this is the last term if you calculate it it's going to be equal to minus 0.3.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.360
So this is going to be a value after the sum function.

01:43.590 --> 01:49.950
But we have been discussing that we have to apply the step function on the sum.

01:49.980 --> 01:57.780
So we have calculated the sum which is equal to minus 0.3 and we have to use the step function on that

01:57.810 --> 01:58.150
given.

01:58.160 --> 02:07.040
Well you and the stat function is going to return 0 if the input is smaller than 0.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.230
Anyways it's going to return a possible arm.

02:10.350 --> 02:18.520
So here because the input for the step function is smaller than zero the output is going to be zero.

02:18.630 --> 02:26.340
So this is why we can say that if we have three inputs with these values and the educates with these

02:26.340 --> 02:31.980
values then the output on a decent our own is going to be zero.

02:32.190 --> 02:34.090
Let's see another example.

02:34.230 --> 02:44.550
In this case the inputs are going to be won won and won and the edge weights are going to be 0.2 0.5

02:44.730 --> 02:46.760
and 0.7.

02:46.800 --> 02:55.860
Again we have to calculate the sum X-1 times double you won plus x 2 times W2 plus x 3 times double

02:55.860 --> 02:57.070
use three.

02:57.510 --> 03:06.250
So one time is 0.2 plus one at times 0.5 plus a one 0.7 is the last term.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.850
It's going to be equal to 1.4.

03:09.030 --> 03:15.660
And because a 1.4 is greater than zero it's going to be one as you can see.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.820
So the output of this.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.900
Now we're on is going to be plus warm.

03:20.940 --> 03:25.280
And basically this is how our networks work.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.160
We have important values.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.000
We have data educates.

03:29.070 --> 03:33.680
We have to sum these actuates and the input values up.

03:33.690 --> 03:40.210
First we have to apply the given inputs with the given actuates and we have to some of these values

03:40.800 --> 03:42.420
and then the step function.

03:42.420 --> 03:50.250
And basically in general the activation function is going to determine what is going to be the output.

03:50.250 --> 03:57.300
This is what we have been discussing that for a stat function the output can be 1 or 0.

03:57.450 --> 04:03.630
But for a sigmoid function the output can be any real the values between 0 and 1.

04:03.750 --> 04:08.910
For example 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 6 7 and something like this.

04:08.940 --> 04:15.210
And this is what we are looking for because if we have these zero where in one output of course.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.310
Now our own network is not going to Virga fine.

04:18.360 --> 04:26.420
We want to make sure that little change in the actuates are going to Coe's little change in the output.

04:26.550 --> 04:29.670
As you can see here we have a very very little.

04:29.700 --> 04:38.780
OK not that really will change but as you can see we have changed the WTU from minus 0.5 to plus 0.5.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.670
Okay and we have changed the input.

04:40.740 --> 04:47.640
So this is not a very very good example but basically illegal changing the educates and the import result

04:47.640 --> 04:51.930
in completely different output zero down one.

04:52.050 --> 04:52.530
OK.

04:52.530 --> 04:56.640
So that's all about the concrete example for O'Berry very simple.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.680
Now we're on that network and Perceptor on tanks or.
