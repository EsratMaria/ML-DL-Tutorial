00:00.630 --> 00:06.300
High in this video we are going to talk about activation functions.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.100
So let's get started.

00:09.300 --> 00:16.780
This is what we have been discussing in the previous video that there are several activation functions.

00:16.890 --> 00:24.030
We have the step function for percept Thrones and we have sigmoid activation function for the sigmoid

00:24.030 --> 00:25.180
network owns.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.410
So basically a stat function is the sign function.

00:28.410 --> 00:35.480
I'm not sure at all you're familiar with this but this function is going to return a minus on it.

00:35.610 --> 00:45.540
If the X impled is smaller than 0 and it's going to return plus 1 if the X input value is greater than

00:45.540 --> 00:46.500
zero.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.920
So we have to apply one of these activation functions on the Somme.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.020
We have calculated previously.

00:54.060 --> 00:59.820
This is what we have been discussing in the previous lecture that does activation functions are going

00:59.820 --> 01:02.590
to determine the output on the given.

01:02.590 --> 01:03.320
Now we're on.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.000
OK first we have to sum up the incoming cycles then we have to apply the activation function on there

01:10.000 --> 01:11.370
to give us some.

01:11.370 --> 01:16.260
So this is the step function we are able to transform it several ways.

01:16.260 --> 01:23.580
For example if we have the X minus a then the stop function is shifted to the right.

01:23.760 --> 01:32.580
And basically it means that this a is this threshold if that given X import is smaller than a dandy

01:32.670 --> 01:39.550
step function is going to return the minus swan if the axiom put is greater then the a threshold.

01:39.630 --> 01:42.440
The step function is going to return a plus one.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.090
So this a basically is the threshold.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.090
OK.

01:47.160 --> 01:54.600
Usually this threshold is zero but a step function can be defined like this that it's not going to return

01:54.600 --> 01:56.580
a minus one and plus one.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.920
But it's going to return 0 when Paswan.

01:59.970 --> 02:06.220
So even the X is smaller than zero then the result is going to be zero.

02:06.390 --> 02:14.120
And if the input for that stat function is greater than zero then the result will be Paswan.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.650
So that's all about a step function by Daler other activation functions.

02:19.650 --> 02:27.840
For example the sigmoid function it is defined something like this wanted D-y by one plus exponential

02:27.840 --> 02:36.210
function to the power of minus X where X is the input as you can see that it can have the values in

02:36.210 --> 02:40.470
the range 0 and warm if the input.

02:40.470 --> 02:49.340
So if the X is very very big then the output of the sigmoid function is going to be won approximately.

02:49.590 --> 02:50.370
The input.

02:50.370 --> 02:58.350
So the X is very very small as you can see the value of the sigmoid function is going to be close to

02:58.350 --> 02:59.130
zero.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.060
So it's going to be a range 0 and 1.

03:03.150 --> 03:10.510
But what's very important that it can have the well use between 0 and 1 the sigmoid function.

03:10.560 --> 03:19.450
Can we turn the well use 0.1 0.2 0.2 to 5 6 0.4 0.8 and so on.

03:19.560 --> 03:26.790
So instead of a binary output 0 when we want as we have seen for the stat function it can have an output

03:26.790 --> 03:29.430
value in the range 0 when.

03:29.650 --> 03:32.550
Any real number in this range.

03:32.610 --> 03:39.090
But you may have the intuition that OK there's some problem with the sigmoid function and the problem

03:39.270 --> 03:42.840
is that it doesn't have any negative values.

03:42.960 --> 03:49.600
And this is why the so-called tangan hyperbolic function has came to be because we are able to return

03:49.630 --> 03:54.040
values ranging from minor Swane to Swan.

03:54.150 --> 04:03.000
It is defined like this exponential X minus exponential minus X divide by exponential X plus exponential

04:03.060 --> 04:10.780
minus X and sometimes it is a better activation function because it can have negative values as well.

04:10.800 --> 04:17.160
We are not going to have a tank and hyperbolic function as an activation of function in the concrete

04:17.160 --> 04:24.690
implementations because we are going to use the sigmoid function and we are going to ENIC code the output

04:24.870 --> 04:29.340
so that the sigmoid function is going to work just fine.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.330
So that's all about the activation functions.

04:32.370 --> 04:38.760
We have the step function we have the sigmoid function and we have the tongue and hyperbolic function

04:38.970 --> 04:42.350
in order we need negative values as well.

04:42.510 --> 04:47.420
And I don't want to repeat myself over and over again but it's crucial to see that.

04:47.460 --> 04:55.050
Why is it good to use for example a sigmoid function because it can have the output 0 and Paswan as

04:55.080 --> 04:57.350
we have seen for desktop function.

04:57.570 --> 05:06.610
But more important that it can have any values besides one and zero so it can have a well you in the

05:06.610 --> 05:08.520
range 0 and 1.

05:08.620 --> 05:15.100
And this is what we are after if you may recall the problem with the percept wrong is that a small change

05:15.100 --> 05:22.150
in the weights of any single person in the network can sometimes code the output of that percept or

05:22.160 --> 05:26.940
on to completely flip from zero to 1 or 2 1 to zero.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.840
And this is why we like sigmoid.

05:28.840 --> 05:34.820
Now we're on because the input and the outputs can take anywhere between 0 and 1.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.620
Ok this is what we have been discussing.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.820
It can be done.

05:38.870 --> 05:44.310
We hop over the sigmoid activation function has the name sigmoid now wrong.

05:44.440 --> 05:51.640
And why is it good because we would like to make sure that small changes in the edge weights cause small

05:51.640 --> 05:53.580
changes in the output.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.270
We don't want to have Flip's at all.

05:56.290 --> 06:03.070
So this is why it's good to use sigmoid function instead of the stat function because Spurr sections

06:03.220 --> 06:05.660
are using stop functions sigmoid.

06:05.690 --> 06:12.460
Now we're ons are using sigmoid function and this is why if we want to make a good out of network we

06:12.460 --> 06:16.260
have to use sigmoid now roans banks are watching.
