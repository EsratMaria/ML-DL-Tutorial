Hide in the studio I would like to talk a bit more about back propagation and basically we have the

00:09.030 --> 00:14.740
input layer the hidden layer and the output layer as usual.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.000
So why this algorithm has the name back propagation.

00:19.260 --> 00:26.760
Basically when we started the algorithm we are going to feed the network with the input data.

00:26.910 --> 00:35.220
So we start from the input layer and we go in the direction of the output layer like this.

00:35.370 --> 00:41.340
Then the hidden roans then the output layer and we calculate the output.

00:41.340 --> 00:49.850
So this is the four stage we keep going from the input layer in the direction of the output layer feeder

00:49.920 --> 00:57.210
or now not with the input data and calculate the output according to the actuates.

00:57.210 --> 01:00.900
But after that we are going to do quite the opposite.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.660
We start at the output.

01:02.770 --> 01:07.620
OK we have the sum basically the activation of the output.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.850
Then we have to calculate the gradient the no data then the arrow basically.

01:13.890 --> 01:20.880
And then we are going to go in the opposite direction starting from the output layer in the direction

01:20.880 --> 01:23.010
of the input layer.

01:23.010 --> 01:26.790
So we go back and we start at the output.

01:26.790 --> 01:33.240
Now we're on danda hidden rounds and we keep updating the adulate accordingly.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.220
So this is the back of her process.

01:35.310 --> 01:39.330
We update the adulate starting from the output layer.

01:39.330 --> 01:45.990
This is why it's called back propagation because as far as the training is concerned we start at the

01:45.990 --> 01:52.620
output and we keep going back Verd basically and we keep updating the edges here.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.900
And then the edges here.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.430
So hence the name back propagation.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.320
Thanks for watching.
