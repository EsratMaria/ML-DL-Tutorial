High in this lecture I would like to show you how to install open CD on Windows.

00:07.080 --> 00:10.740
I think if you have Linux operating system it is quite easy.

00:10.740 --> 00:14.670
First of all it's quite easy to search on the Web how to install it.

00:14.760 --> 00:21.090
But with the help of the Coleman line abt pseudo once so one it's much more convenient and on Windows

00:21.570 --> 00:27.080
on Windows you have to type that download open CD.

00:27.540 --> 00:28.480
OK.

00:28.650 --> 00:35.100
We have the downloads and I think that we are able to download the open CD from sourceforge.

00:35.220 --> 00:41.790
So if you click on the open C-v for Windows or download open you will start in four seconds.

00:41.790 --> 00:47.870
So the open CD is going to be downloaded as you can see there's the open CD.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.850
I have already have open CD on my system so I'm not going to install it I just show you that you have

00:53.850 --> 00:58.010
to double click as you can see there's the X extension.

00:58.050 --> 01:02.690
So you just have to double click it and the Windows operating system is going to install it for you

01:02.690 --> 01:03.530
basically.

01:03.720 --> 01:10.080
What's very important that after the installation process we have this sad path as usual as we have

01:10.080 --> 01:13.100
seen for other JDK and so on.

01:13.380 --> 01:17.100
So I guess it is going to be downloaded in seconds.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.040
OK.

01:18.150 --> 01:21.390
Right click open for other.

01:21.420 --> 01:24.390
And this is the open CVB are looking for.

01:24.640 --> 01:33.480
OK so we have to double click it open see the it's going to be extracted to see user's user downloads.

01:33.630 --> 01:35.270
OK.

01:38.780 --> 01:45.620
OK and after it has been unsaved let's search for open see as you can see if you are going to have an

01:45.620 --> 01:47.350
open see the folder.

01:47.510 --> 01:50.200
And here we will have the bill basically.

01:50.270 --> 01:58.100
And then first of all maybe I'm going to copy and paste it because I don't like to store my stuff in

01:58.100 --> 02:06.040
the download so I'm going to cut this open C.V folder and I'm going to navigate to the program files.

02:06.110 --> 02:09.810
I'm going to I'm going to paste it here.

02:10.190 --> 02:11.770
OK.

02:13.100 --> 02:18.900
So it's going to be in C program files and you have to navigate to that build.

02:18.950 --> 02:27.140
And then as usual and you have to copy this part so see Program Files open see the building on my machine

02:27.670 --> 02:31.740
and I'm going to search for the environmental variables.

02:31.970 --> 02:35.060
So let's search for the environmental variables.

02:35.060 --> 02:35.840
So ready for that.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.310
My operating system speaks Hungarian.

02:38.540 --> 02:45.710
But you have to search for in the settings that will have the CCed tools networking and internet connections

02:45.710 --> 02:52.510
security and something like this and you search for the environmental variety obols modification and

02:52.520 --> 02:54.050
you will get something like this.

02:54.050 --> 02:54.630
We did.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.660
And environmental variables.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.540
And we are looking for the Parthiv south.

02:59.690 --> 03:04.510
So we have to clean the path so we have to modify it.

03:04.670 --> 03:06.830
We have to click on the new one.

03:06.830 --> 03:13.490
It is the Windows operating system so it's a bit more convenient than doing it on Windows 8 or Windows

03:13.580 --> 03:15.450
7 or something like this.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.710
And you have to pace that so you will have the C program files open see the build.

03:20.750 --> 03:27.790
Been on the past basically as you can see I have already did it with Java JDK.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.430
I have read that the data were just way too wide.

03:30.430 --> 03:35.760
Fly server with the Java runtime environment Wiedmaier skew server.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.830
So this is the standard case.

03:37.850 --> 03:43.810
You install something and you update the environmental variables and you set it to the path.

03:44.060 --> 03:48.440
OK so that's click OK let's click OK.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.980
And it means that the open CV is on the path.

03:52.010 --> 03:59.850
If you navigate to the console so command line and I think we are able to narrow that path.

04:00.150 --> 04:08.300
OK I have several items on the path such as the wild fly as we have discussed Apache Mavor in Java runtime

04:08.300 --> 04:15.050
environment and as you can see after we have updated the classpath there's going to be the program files

04:15.110 --> 04:21.500
open see the build been on the classpath So this is how we setup open see the answer.

04:21.510 --> 04:21.990
Watching.
