00:01.020 --> 00:04.920
In this chapter we are going to talk about computer vision.

00:05.010 --> 00:09.390
OK we are going to focus on how to detect human faces.

00:09.450 --> 00:14.610
But basically with the help of these approaches we can detect the objects we want.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.450
For example we are able to detect cars.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.580
We are able to detect animals.

00:19.710 --> 00:23.790
We are able to detect horses pedestrians and so on.

00:23.790 --> 00:27.400
So this is why computer vision is extremely important.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.760
And basically self-driving cars relies heavily on computer wisdom.

00:32.790 --> 00:39.420
So far we have been dealing with known datasets no matter we have been talking about linear regression

00:39.630 --> 00:44.310
logistic regression Navy based classifiers or supporting actor machines.

00:44.430 --> 00:47.070
We knew the underlying data sets.

00:47.100 --> 00:54.120
For example when dealing with hand with 10 digits we have these missed dataset and we know that there

00:54.120 --> 00:57.350
are 28 by 28 big solids images.

00:57.420 --> 01:01.050
We know that these are going to be handwritten digits.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.630
So there are 10 output clauses.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.600
0 1 2 3 up to 9.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.510
So basically we know what are we looking for.

01:09.510 --> 01:13.800
We have a data set with 28 by 28 big source images.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.850
We have 10 output classes and we know for certain that within this dataset there are going to be hands

01:20.850 --> 01:22.140
with 10 digits.

01:22.140 --> 01:25.270
These are not going to be hand written characters.

01:25.290 --> 01:32.190
These are not going to be images of cars or animals for example where we know the underlying data set.

01:32.310 --> 01:39.270
It is the same when dealing we face recognition so not face detection but face recognition we have this

01:39.360 --> 01:48.360
Olivetti data set containing 64 by 64 pixels images and we know for certain that these images are human

01:48.360 --> 01:55.650
faces and the aim is to learn the most relevant features of these given faces in order to be able to

01:55.650 --> 01:56.940
recognize them.

01:56.940 --> 02:03.390
So that's the main difference between supervised learning algorithms and a computer vision that as far

02:03.390 --> 02:10.410
as computer vision is concerned we are after a general solution if we have a given image we want to

02:10.410 --> 02:14.730
make sure the algorithm is able to detect and recognize objects.

02:14.850 --> 02:18.750
For example human faces cars or horses.

02:18.780 --> 02:25.320
So what is the main difference if we have nice data set we know for certain that these are going to

02:25.320 --> 02:26.320
be digits.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.300
So we are able to tune in machine learning algorithms or now Real Networks accordingly.

02:32.460 --> 02:36.630
We know for certain that these are going to be handwritten digits.

02:36.870 --> 02:42.760
If we take a look at the second image the aim of the algorithm is to detect human faces.

02:42.900 --> 02:47.550
But this image doesn't contain human faces exclusivity.

02:47.550 --> 02:50.820
There are several boatloads of mineral water.

02:50.900 --> 02:51.330
OK.

02:51.340 --> 02:55.370
There's some cable there's a microphone in the center of the image.

02:55.410 --> 03:03.120
So there are lots of lots of objects that are not faces as you can see as far as handwritten digit recognition

03:03.120 --> 03:04.010
is concerned.

03:04.080 --> 03:09.950
We know for certain that this data set is not going to contain different objects.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.140
This dataset is about handwritten digits.

03:13.260 --> 03:19.830
On the other hand when dealing with computer vision where we are after a human faces but the given image

03:19.860 --> 03:22.610
can contain other objects as well.

03:22.680 --> 03:29.370
So basically we have to know that OK a given region of the image contains a human face.

03:29.510 --> 03:35.200
And we have to know that other parts of the image do not contain human faces.

03:35.370 --> 03:42.630
OK so that's why computer region and object detection is a much harder problem than supervised learning

03:42.630 --> 03:43.160
algorithm.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.330
We have been discussing so far.

03:45.330 --> 03:48.660
So this is what we are going to talk about in the next lectures.

03:48.660 --> 03:49.510
Thanks for watching.
