High in this video we are going to talk about the parent teacher as of a detached Malte scale function

00:06.630 --> 00:08.000
or method.

00:08.040 --> 00:14.510
So far we have seen the default configuration where we have we we just have to specify the image itself.

00:14.520 --> 00:24.720
The gray image become battey the color image to Viji are gray and we made our algorithm on the greyscale

00:24.720 --> 00:31.560
image so we can satisfy the scale factor the neighbor as the minimum size and whatsoever.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.860
I just use this configuration.

00:34.050 --> 00:42.660
And first of all I'm going to run it on the standard image that was working fine to be the default parameters

00:42.690 --> 00:46.850
as well as you can see it's working fine again.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.700
But let's see for example I would like to run my algorithm on the first image.

00:54.060 --> 01:03.750
There are some mismatch if you may recall with the default perimeters OK and there is no mismatch anymore

01:03.870 --> 01:11.220
although as you can see there is again and undetected face so this algorithm is not always working fine

01:11.280 --> 01:18.600
but for most of the cases they really should to in the scale paramita so far again and again we should

01:18.600 --> 01:26.040
make a cross-validation like algorithm which means that we tune every perimeter and we come to the conclusion

01:26.040 --> 01:33.650
that OK this is the Bassat of parameters and that is Billis solution of let's say for example I would

01:33.650 --> 01:41.700
like to use on the image Swee if I want it it's quite a complex image with lots of lots of faces

01:45.090 --> 01:48.920
as you see there's a lot of lots of mismatches right now.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.630
So maybe I should tune it

01:54.180 --> 02:03.290
if I set it for example to taen the minimum neighbors and I set a scale factor for example 1 that two

02:06.470 --> 02:09.530
as you can see that now it is a bit better.

02:09.530 --> 02:16.100
There is no mismatches at all although there are three phases that hasn't been detected.

02:17.210 --> 02:19.310
So let's see I'm going to set it back.

02:19.310 --> 02:23.370
For example 0 1 dart 0 1.

02:23.870 --> 02:31.760
It's going to be very slow but only after a hand it will be able to detect more faces.

02:37.110 --> 02:38.060
And let's see.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.770
OK there are lots of lots of mismatches again.

02:40.950 --> 02:46.210
So maybe I set it back to one that won that was OK.

02:48.190 --> 02:51.160
But we have managed to detect these faces.

02:51.190 --> 02:56.090
This is very hard to detect.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.500
And as you can see this is quite a fine paramita sat.

03:08.530 --> 03:15.970
So whenever a scale factor is one that won the mean neighbor is tan and I'm inside is served by 30 then

03:15.970 --> 03:19.860
we are able to detect most of the faces without any mismatch.

03:20.050 --> 03:25.740
Of course we have one single undetected phase but it's very very hard to detect.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.580
So our or our fate it actually really is white working fine.

03:29.590 --> 03:34.600
We just have to find the tune paramita for it.

03:34.660 --> 03:37.840
So that's all about these tuning parameters.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.640
Thanks for watching.
