00:00.390 --> 00:08.400
Buy in this video we are going to talk about the parameters for Phasee action and for these cascade

00:08.400 --> 00:16.200
classifier as we have discussed earlier we have these cascade classify or detax multi scale and we just

00:16.200 --> 00:23.400
specify the gray image and we came to the conclusion that OK sometimes it works fine that sometimes

00:23.400 --> 00:24.580
it does not.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.110
And that's why we have to tune the perimeter.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.730
And there are several parameters for the pack.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.420
With the scale matter or function.

00:33.140 --> 00:39.630
And first of all the most important one is the so-called scale factor since some faces may be closer

00:39.630 --> 00:46.350
to the camera they would appear bigger than our faces in the background and a scale factor compensates

00:46.350 --> 00:48.050
for this a fact.

00:48.090 --> 00:58.100
So specifying added the scale factor specifies how much the image size is use at each image scale.

00:58.230 --> 01:06.470
So the model has a fixed sized defined doing the training in a so-called Haret cascade frontal face.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.040
That X-amount we have discussed in the previous video.

01:10.360 --> 01:19.920
MRL parameters and by rescaling the input image you can resize a larger face the smaller one making

01:19.920 --> 01:22.520
it detectable by the algorithm.

01:22.530 --> 01:25.730
So that's why the scale factor is very important.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.690
The value has to be greater than one.

01:28.890 --> 01:35.830
So the standard value is between 1 and 1 to 1 4 so this is the standard region.

01:36.030 --> 01:40.510
If it's small of course it has to be greater than 1 as I said earlier.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.610
But if it's small the algorithm will be slow Zane's it is more sorrow if it's high.

01:47.610 --> 01:53.450
The algorithm will be faster but with the risk of missing some faces altogether.

01:53.670 --> 02:01.290
So if there are some undetected faces then we should reduce the scale factor.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.380
We have some other paramita such as the main neighbors.

02:05.430 --> 02:11.310
It defines the minimum neighbor as the name suggests so specifying how many neighbors each candidate's

02:11.310 --> 02:14.330
weak tangles should have to retain it.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.210
This cascade classified allow freedom works.

02:18.370 --> 02:24.540
It goes from left to right step by step and we have all this main neighbor we specify that how many

02:26.010 --> 02:32.420
rectangles should have to be painted and a value interval is from 3 to 6.

02:32.430 --> 02:39.020
The higher the values the lads the actions they are but with higher quality.

02:39.570 --> 02:43.430
So maybe we should too sometimes the mean neighbor has perimeters.

02:43.710 --> 02:50.100
The flag stands for it's kind of a hairy stick which reject some image regions that contain too few

02:50.100 --> 02:54.710
or too much edges and thus cannot contain the search object.

02:54.780 --> 03:00.270
And if we know it we can skip it without further iterations.

03:00.270 --> 03:07.470
So it's kind of how restack It's like pruning a tree that we are familiar with again these chests and

03:07.470 --> 03:08.750
genes and so on.

03:08.910 --> 03:14.670
But it's kind of a hairy stick we prune and we get rid of things that that we are sure that it's not

03:14.670 --> 03:16.200
going to be a face.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.950
And why is it gold because Uralic them will be faster.

03:19.950 --> 03:26.340
And we have the minimum size and the maximum size them in size they find are the objects smaller than

03:26.420 --> 03:26.810
a dam.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.450
This means size will be ignored.

03:29.580 --> 03:34.470
So we can find one of the smallest objects we want to recognize.

03:34.470 --> 03:36.870
I think the standard is 30 by 30.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.900
And of course we have a maximum size.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.060
So objects larger than the maximum size will be ignored.

03:43.080 --> 03:53.460
So if we have resample faces huge faces then we should consider that the maximum size should be tuned

03:53.580 --> 03:54.290
and so on.

03:54.300 --> 04:01.770
If we have very little face as he wanted the on our images then we should use the minimum size to be

04:01.770 --> 04:03.350
able to detect it.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.930
So these are the most important factors and parameters.

04:06.930 --> 04:07.740
Thanks for watching.
