00:01.660 --> 00:08.170
So far so good we have managed to fudge the data set and we have managed to get the adjusted closing

00:08.170 --> 00:15.250
prices because we are going to train the deep now and then work on the adjusted closing prices and we

00:15.250 --> 00:20.600
are going to make predictions as far as adjusted closing prices are concerned.

00:20.830 --> 00:24.200
Okay then we have to use normalization.

00:24.310 --> 00:27.310
We are going to use minimax normalization.

00:27.400 --> 00:33.120
This is what we have been discussing as well when dealing with K nearest neighbor a classifier that

00:33.130 --> 00:41.870
we have two options for normalization minimax normalization and z score normalization or standardization.

00:41.980 --> 00:48.820
As far as standardization is concerned we are dealing with the mean and standard deviation for minimax

00:48.820 --> 00:49.960
normalization.

00:50.050 --> 00:56.000
We are dealing with minimum value in the dataset and the maximum value in the dataset.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.190
So this is what we are going to use.

00:58.330 --> 01:05.880
This process transforms a feature such that all of its values fall in a range between 0 and 1.

01:05.920 --> 01:13.180
So the X new musicals 2 x minus the minimum value divided by the maximum minus the minimum value.

01:13.180 --> 01:14.280
Why is it good.

01:14.350 --> 01:21.400
Because this is how we can transform all the values within the range 0 and 1 so we can do it with the

01:21.400 --> 01:28.330
help of seeking to learn a pre-processing minimax scale or we just have to define that the feature range

01:28.600 --> 01:30.810
will be zero and warm.

01:30.970 --> 01:31.550
Okay.

01:31.570 --> 01:36.080
And then we can call it the feet transform on the training data set.

01:36.130 --> 01:42.790
This is going to be the scaled training set that will have the values within it zero and warm.

01:42.790 --> 01:49.630
So if we search for the scale the training set lets double click disvalue as you can see instead of

01:49.630 --> 01:57.940
the actual stock prices we have transformed stock prices and all of these values are within 0 1 1.

01:57.940 --> 01:58.910
Why is it good.

01:58.930 --> 02:05.890
Because most of the machine learning algorithms are going to get higher accuracy if we use normalization

02:05.980 --> 02:08.710
such as this minimax normalization.

02:08.710 --> 02:15.170
So this is why we have to use when we are dealing with stock market related data in the next lecture

02:15.190 --> 02:21.790
we are going to create the training data set features and the training data set target values.

02:21.790 --> 02:22.670
Thanks for watching.
