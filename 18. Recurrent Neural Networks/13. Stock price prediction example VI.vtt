00:01.690 --> 00:07.930
In the last lecture we have been talking about Alice D.M. architecture how to compile and how to fit

00:07.930 --> 00:08.980
the model.

00:08.980 --> 00:13.380
Now it's time to test whether the algorithm is working fine or not.

00:13.570 --> 00:19.410
So first of all we have taken Kattan aid the training data set with that task data set.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.050
Why.

00:20.050 --> 00:26.950
Because if we want to make some predictions in the past dataset of course for example the prediction

00:27.070 --> 00:34.420
as far as the first sample is concerned it relies heavily on the previous 40 samples and the previous

00:34.420 --> 00:38.410
40 samples are located within the training data set.

00:38.410 --> 00:42.220
OK because as you may recall we use 40 features.

00:42.340 --> 00:47.940
So for the stock prices in the past in order to spread the stock price tomorrow.

00:48.120 --> 00:48.850
OK.

00:48.940 --> 00:55.840
So that's why we have to concatenate the training data set and test data set as far as the adjusted

00:55.870 --> 00:57.800
closing prices are concerned.

00:57.880 --> 01:04.370
And if we had the axes to be zero it's going to be a vertical concatenation.

01:04.390 --> 01:08.190
So if the axis is zero it is vertical.

01:08.290 --> 01:13.480
If the access is equal to 1 it's going to be horizontal concatenation.

01:13.480 --> 01:21.460
So if we take a look at these data set total as you can see we have training data set and the data we

01:21.460 --> 01:23.140
have the test data set.

01:23.140 --> 01:31.200
So as you can see we have concatenated the training data set and test data set in a vertical manner.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.110
So that's why we use axes 0 for vertical concatenation.

01:36.160 --> 01:43.810
OK then we have to calculate the input features for that past data set and with the help of this line

01:43.810 --> 01:46.980
of code we slagged the important inputs.

01:47.010 --> 01:54.550
So from the total data set we are going to calculate the lengths of the dataset minus the lengths of

01:54.580 --> 02:02.200
the price data set so that test dataset minus 40 because we need the items in the training data set

02:02.440 --> 02:06.270
in order to protect the values from the task data set.

02:06.430 --> 02:12.970
OK then we have to reshape these values data because then our own network is trained on the scale the

02:12.970 --> 02:18.230
values we have to use minimax normalization on the input as well.

02:18.370 --> 02:21.310
So this minimax scaler is already fit there.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.260
So instead of feet transform we can use this transform directly.

02:26.290 --> 02:29.570
So this is how we get that transformed input.

02:29.830 --> 02:36.980
And again we have to create a one dimensional array for the test features and we have to use these for

02:36.980 --> 02:42.350
a loop in order to create a data set like this with all of the relevant features.

02:42.410 --> 02:48.760
OK in this case we have three features but in the implementations we have 40 features.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.730
So for these stock prices in the past.

02:51.730 --> 02:56.970
Okay so thats why we use 40 and minus 40 up to our eye.

02:57.010 --> 03:04.180
As far as the roads are concerned and all the values from the first column we are dealing with a single

03:04.270 --> 03:10.020
adjusted closing price so thats why the zero index column is going to be adjusted.

03:10.030 --> 03:18.160
Closing prices then we can create a non-pilot array out of the X test values and then we have to reshape

03:18.160 --> 03:19.300
these items.

03:19.300 --> 03:24.820
This is exactly what we have discussed here because in order to make some predictions we are recurrent

03:24.850 --> 03:30.910
now and that we have to end up with these die imagines the first dimension imagine is the number of

03:30.910 --> 03:31.840
samples.

03:31.840 --> 03:38.200
Then we have the number of features that we have the number of target variables because we are after

03:38.200 --> 03:39.870
the adjusted closing price.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.400
It is a single value.

03:41.410 --> 03:43.790
So thats why we have a warm up.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.780
OK so this is why we have to use reshape.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.060
With something like this.

03:48.070 --> 03:54.260
Finally we kind of make predictions with the help of the model predicate on the past the data set.

03:54.280 --> 04:00.260
These are going to be the predictions but we make predictions on the scale the data set.

04:00.310 --> 04:07.850
So we just have to use these inverse transformations in order to end up with the predicted stock prices.

04:07.930 --> 04:08.400
Okay.

04:08.410 --> 04:12.510
So we don't want to bother with the values within the range 0 and 1.

04:12.580 --> 04:18.310
We would like to make predictions something like this that the stock price is two thousand two hundred

04:18.370 --> 04:20.770
nineteen dollars for example and so on.

04:20.770 --> 04:28.900
So this is why we need this inverse transformation and then we just have to Plaut the actual S&amp;P 500

04:28.900 --> 04:34.320
prices and the stock price is predicted by the LSD model.

04:34.360 --> 04:42.100
So we have the title we have the labels time and prices accordingly and we just have to call the show

04:42.130 --> 04:45.230
function in order to show order give them plot.

04:45.250 --> 04:49.210
So in the next lecture we are going to talk about the results.

04:49.210 --> 04:50.090
Thanks for watching.
