00:01.690 --> 00:09.010
First of all we have to Fadge that given the data sets we have a training data set and we have a task

00:09.060 --> 00:10.040
data set.

00:10.110 --> 00:16.660
What's very important that we are going to make some predictions concerning S&amp;P 500.

00:16.780 --> 00:22.650
So if you search for S&amp;P 500 first of all you can check the prices.

00:22.810 --> 00:30.460
OK we are going to deal with historical data from 2000 and 10 I guess up to 2000 and 17.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.920
So this is the time series we are going to handle.

00:33.940 --> 00:42.760
By the way S&amp;P 500 it stands for Standard and Poor's 500 which is an American stock market index based

00:42.760 --> 00:51.340
on the market capitalization of the 500 largest companies such as Google Apple Tesla Wal-Mart and so

00:51.340 --> 00:51.660
on.

00:51.730 --> 00:57.430
So we are going to forecast future prices of S&amp;P 500 index.

00:57.430 --> 01:02.310
You can download the data that I have already created a training data set.

01:02.350 --> 01:02.800
OK.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.400
The first sample is 2012 January 3rd.

01:07.420 --> 01:15.100
So this is the first sample we'd open price high price low price close price adjusted closing price

01:15.130 --> 01:16.090
and volume.

01:16.150 --> 01:23.900
So this is the first sample in the data set and we have lost sample 2000 and 16 December.

01:24.040 --> 01:24.520
Okay.

01:24.520 --> 01:31.600
So this is the training data set we are going to use recurrent now Real Networks and LSD YEM architecture

01:31.630 --> 01:36.230
in order to find the relationships between the features.

01:36.420 --> 01:36.930
Okay.

01:36.940 --> 01:39.390
And we have a test data set.

01:39.490 --> 01:45.080
We are going to forecast S&amp;P 500 prices for the next month.

01:45.100 --> 01:51.860
So as you can see the last date in the training data set is the end of 2016.

01:51.920 --> 01:57.170
I know we are going to make predictions for the January of 2017.

01:57.310 --> 02:01.360
Okay so we are going to use 20 task's samples.

02:01.360 --> 02:08.200
So first of all we have the Fadge the training data set and the past data set what's very important

02:08.410 --> 02:14.110
that we are going to deal with the adjusted closing prices you may pose the question that what does

02:14.110 --> 02:16.140
it mean adjusted closing price is.

02:16.150 --> 02:19.310
It is very similar to closing prices of the store.

02:19.340 --> 02:25.040
But it takes into account factors such as dividend stock and so on.

02:25.150 --> 02:30.930
So usually adjusted closing price is a more accurate reflection of the stock's value.

02:30.940 --> 02:38.350
So thats why instead of the open price or the closing price we are going to use adjusted closing price.

02:38.430 --> 02:44.850
Okay so this is how we read the cxxviii files as far as the training data set.

02:45.010 --> 02:48.240
And as far as the past dataset is concerned.

02:48.310 --> 02:53.970
Okay then this is how we get a given color MoVida half of this I lock function.

02:54.070 --> 02:59.520
So we are after all the rows but we have to define the given column.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.080
We just want to deal with the adjusted closing price column.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.250
So thats why we have to define five and six.

03:06.280 --> 03:15.900
It is going to be the index of adjusted closing price 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 5 and 6 as you can see.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.330
Okay this is how we get the training data set and the test data set.

03:20.530 --> 03:28.660
If we take a look at verifiable or you can see that the task set is going to be a pie array.

03:28.690 --> 03:35.920
We had 20 rows and a single column if you double click the tasks that you can take a look at the concrete

03:35.920 --> 03:36.770
values.

03:36.790 --> 03:41.260
So as you can see the first value is two thousand two hundred and fifty seven.

03:41.260 --> 03:46.900
Two hundred and two thousand and fifty seven as you can see the last value is two thousand two hundred

03:46.900 --> 03:47.930
seventy eight.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.980
So 2278.

03:51.070 --> 03:56.570
So this is how we do the test data set and we have the training data set.

03:56.590 --> 03:58.480
You can double click it as well.

03:58.540 --> 04:05.730
And these are the values from the training data set we are going to deal with the adjusted closing prices

04:05.760 --> 04:10.420
exclusively so thats why we have just a single column in this dataset.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.110
Okay.

04:11.110 --> 04:16.060
In the next lecture we are going to talk about how to normalize the dataset.

04:16.060 --> 04:16.960
Thanks for watching.
