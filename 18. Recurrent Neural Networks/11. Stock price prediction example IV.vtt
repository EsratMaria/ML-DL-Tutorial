00:01.810 --> 00:05.100
OK so let's create the training data set.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.450
We are after something like this.

00:07.530 --> 00:15.990
In this case we have three features so sorry stock prices in the past of course in our example we are

00:15.990 --> 00:18.350
going to have 40 features.

00:18.450 --> 00:28.030
So x1 x2 x 3 up to x 40 because we are going to press the exact target variable based on 40 stocks of

00:28.040 --> 00:29.550
values in the past.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.910
So we are after something like this.

00:31.930 --> 00:37.440
We have the features so X-1 avail you X-2 they'll you extreme value.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.180
And we have the target of a valuable accordingly.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.940
Then we shifted the window Wanstead to the right.

00:42.960 --> 00:50.040
And again we are going to get the stock prices from the historical data set in order to construct the

00:50.040 --> 00:51.480
training data set.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.480
And what's very important because if we shift this window one step to the right there are going to be

00:57.480 --> 01:01.050
approximately the same values in the training data set.

01:01.050 --> 01:02.160
So what does it mean.

01:02.250 --> 01:08.970
We have the first throw and the second row is going to have the same they'll use except for the last

01:08.970 --> 01:09.450
one.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.920
So this we want to is the same as P-T one does.

01:13.970 --> 01:21.200
The one story is the same as the 2 and so on because we shaved the window one step to the right.

01:21.250 --> 01:26.070
There's going to be the same values as far as the given stock price is concerned.

01:26.130 --> 01:32.560
So we just have to create a one dimensional array for the features and a one dimensional array for the

01:32.580 --> 01:34.020
target values.

01:34.020 --> 01:38.050
We have to create a for loop y to start with 40.

01:38.130 --> 01:41.420
Basically disvalue is the end of the array.

01:41.520 --> 01:48.450
So if we take a look at the training sakte we have it one thousand two hundred fifty two rows in the

01:48.450 --> 01:49.920
training data set.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.610
So that's why we are going to have this value as the upper bound.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.790
But why to start with 40.

01:56.790 --> 01:59.610
Because when we construct the first sample.

01:59.640 --> 02:07.770
So in this case as you can see the first target variable is going to be the fourth item because we calculate

02:07.770 --> 02:11.190
the target value based on previous values.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.940
This is how a machine learning algorithm works.

02:13.950 --> 02:18.170
We have some training data and we have the target values.

02:18.180 --> 02:25.290
So in this case the first 40 values are going to be the features and the next item is going to be the

02:25.290 --> 02:26.000
target.

02:26.040 --> 02:31.340
OK so we use the previous 40 prices in order to forecast the next one.

02:31.470 --> 02:35.810
So that's why we get the values from the skilled training set.

02:35.880 --> 02:41.880
This has something to do with the role we index and it does have something to do with the Carlen index

02:42.150 --> 02:47.790
the Cullom index is quite straightforward because we just have a single Culham the adjusted closing

02:47.790 --> 02:48.580
prices.

02:48.630 --> 02:50.220
That's why we use zero.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.650
So zero represents the first column.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.430
We have just a single column.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.960
OK but what about this one.

02:56.970 --> 03:03.330
It means that we are going to consider the values as far as our index is concerned.

03:03.330 --> 03:09.520
So I'm minus 40 who we have to substract 40 because we have 40 features.

03:09.570 --> 03:16.270
So we are going to handle the items starting from minus 40 up to.

03:16.410 --> 03:22.970
What is it mean that this is exactly what we are after that the first three items are the features.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.330
And the next item is the target variable.

03:26.430 --> 03:36.450
The first 40 items are the training features and the next item is the target of a viable X train is

03:36.450 --> 03:38.020
the training features.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.500
Why train is the training target variable.

03:41.520 --> 03:49.540
So this is how we create these two dimensional array basically for the features and for the target.

03:49.590 --> 03:56.270
And then we would like to end up with the non-pay arrays so that's why we use pi array on the X Thrain

03:56.500 --> 03:57.780
and the wine train.

03:57.810 --> 04:04.630
Then if we want to use SDM architecture we have to reshape these non-pay arrays.

04:04.710 --> 04:08.210
So we would like to end up with something like this.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.280
We have three dimensions.

04:10.380 --> 04:18.190
The number of total samples the number of features and one because we have just a single target variable.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.560
We would like to predict the stock price to morrow.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.830
Okay that's why we have one.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.950
What about the number of features.

04:25.950 --> 04:34.320
The number of features is equal to 40 but we are able to get it from the X thrain dot shape one is going

04:34.320 --> 04:36.680
to return the number of features.

04:36.750 --> 04:43.240
Basically the number of columns as far as the features are concerned here we have three features.

04:43.260 --> 04:48.380
But as far as the concrete implementation is concerned we have 40 features.

04:48.480 --> 04:48.950
Okay.

04:48.960 --> 04:54.830
So this is equal to 40 and this is equal to the total number of samples.

04:54.840 --> 05:01.770
So in the training data set we have to calculate the number of fros okay and we can get this well you

05:01.880 --> 05:03.610
with the help of this shape.

05:03.610 --> 05:04.310
Zero.

05:04.450 --> 05:11.320
So basically this is the last transformation we have to use in order to use these values with recurrent

05:11.350 --> 05:14.880
now and that work and Alice YEM architecture.

05:14.950 --> 05:21.200
So we just have to define the number of samples number of features and the number of target variables.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.600
This is how we end up with a three dimensional array.

05:24.610 --> 05:29.560
OK so this is the X Graines So the features for the training data set.

05:29.740 --> 05:37.090
And we have the target of triable is for the training data sadly adjusted closing prices tomorrow ok

05:37.120 --> 05:42.490
in the next lecture we are going to talk about how to build the LSD model.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.370
Thanks for watching.
