00:01.670 --> 00:08.710
So if you run this algorithm this first method is going to take approximately 20 minutes to finish.

00:08.840 --> 00:13.580
So I have already ran it the algorithm and this is the solution.

00:13.700 --> 00:19.350
So as you can see blue line is the actual S&amp;P 500 Pisces.

00:19.370 --> 00:26.180
I have downloaded from Yahoo Finance and the green line is the prediction made by the model as you can

00:26.180 --> 00:32.750
see we are able to analyze the trends with the help of recurrent natural networks and long short term

00:32.750 --> 00:34.210
memory architecture.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.490
We are not able to grasp the daily changes.

00:37.490 --> 00:43.510
So as you can see we are not able to end up with an algorithm that's going to be able to predict all

00:43.520 --> 00:44.840
the little movements.

00:44.840 --> 00:52.010
But as you can see it is able to understand the trends here for example at the beginning the stock price

00:52.010 --> 00:52.790
went up.

00:52.790 --> 00:58.870
So as you can see the stock price went up according to our model here in this region.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.310
The stock price began to fall.

01:01.390 --> 01:06.540
So ISTM architecture is able to predict this trend as well.

01:06.590 --> 01:11.790
And as you can see it is able to predict that the stock price is going to increase.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.160
As you can see the stock price has increased.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.590
OK then the value has decreased.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.790
But in the main we are happily recurrent now where all the networks we are able to understand the trends

01:22.880 --> 01:32.540
in stock prices by the way we have analyzed a data set starting from 2001 to now up to 2000 and 16 within

01:32.540 --> 01:36.800
this interval the volatility was approximately constant.

01:36.890 --> 01:39.790
So there hasn't been any volatility clustering.

01:39.860 --> 01:48.410
So if we take a look at the splot we have been dealing with these values here so 2010 13 Okay approximately

01:48.650 --> 01:50.600
up to 2000 and 16.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.230
So as you can see here the volatility was approximately constant.

01:55.280 --> 02:03.020
If we click on maximum there's been a huge volatility clustering around 2008 so this is the big financial

02:03.020 --> 02:03.650
crisis.

02:03.680 --> 02:11.090
So I've been testing recurrent now run networks in the past three weeks and I came to the conclusion

02:11.390 --> 02:16.640
that it is working quite fine when the volatility is approximately constant.

02:16.700 --> 02:23.530
It is not going to yield good results during the financial crisis with high variance in volatility.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.630
It is not going to develop now a days when theres a huge volatility clustering.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.870
As far as S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones is concerned.

02:32.930 --> 02:35.230
So the conclusion is recurrent.

02:35.260 --> 02:42.630
Now run networks and deep learning in domain is able to predict trends as far as stock prices are concerned.

02:42.650 --> 02:46.540
In my opinion we have to combine deep learning algorithms.

02:46.570 --> 02:52.370
We need time series analyzes in order to end up with a rather good trading algorithm.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.290
Thanks for watching.
