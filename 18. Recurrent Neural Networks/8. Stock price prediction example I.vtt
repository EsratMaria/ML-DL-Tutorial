00:01.830 --> 00:09.640
Incoming lectures we are going to use deep learning and LSD architecture in order to forecast stock

00:09.640 --> 00:10.630
prices.

00:10.630 --> 00:17.350
So first of all let's talk a bit about the difference between time series analyzes and a deep learning

00:17.350 --> 00:21.010
approach as far as time series analyzes is concerned.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.370
We have quite complex models.

00:23.410 --> 00:30.340
So there's the random Valke model as the basis of Time series analyzes data we can do a bit better with

00:30.430 --> 00:33.700
our two regressive or moving average models.

00:33.760 --> 00:40.600
We are able to combine these models in order to end up with the out or aggressive moving average model.

00:40.600 --> 00:46.750
Dan RBD better approach is the so called out or aggressive integrated moving average model.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.920
And we are able to combine it.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.310
We'd better whiskers stick more tools in order to account for the volatility clustering.

00:54.310 --> 00:59.660
Okay so these are the arch and Gottsch models combining these motiveless.

00:59.680 --> 01:06.530
So every memorial we digitalize out or aggressive hetero's scholastic model is working quite fine on

01:06.530 --> 01:10.330
the 4 X or when we try to predict stock prices.

01:10.330 --> 01:17.260
So what's very important that for time series analyzes we have quite complex modals with underlying

01:17.290 --> 01:24.610
parameters such as the volatility and so on the huge advantage of Time series analyzes methods that

01:24.670 --> 01:31.670
they can deal with volatility clustering and that's why they are working quite fine during crisis.

01:31.720 --> 01:39.700
So for example if we take a look at the Dow Jones Index focusing on the 2008 financial crisis as you

01:39.700 --> 01:43.330
can see there's been a huge volatility clustering here.

01:43.330 --> 01:47.850
What does it mean that volatility had a huge variance here.

01:47.850 --> 01:54.090
Volatility is approximately constant but here volatility has been changed a lot.

01:54.250 --> 02:00.460
And with the cap of time series analyze these methods for example of the combined Arima Gottsch model

02:00.670 --> 02:05.050
we are able to make good predictions even in these situations.

02:05.040 --> 02:13.210
So for example the 2008 financial crisis or for example at the beginning of 2018 there's been a huge

02:13.210 --> 02:17.570
volatility clustering as far as S&amp;P 500 is concerned.

02:17.590 --> 02:22.380
As you can see there's a huge volatility clustering here in this region.

02:22.390 --> 02:29.350
There has been little changes as far as the price and the value of S&amp;P 500 is concerned.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.180
So volatility is approximately constant.

02:32.200 --> 02:38.980
But here in this region there's been a huge volatility clustering and a time series analyze these related

02:38.980 --> 02:47.040
methods are working fine in this situation only or our hand deep learning and SDMI architecture is a

02:47.040 --> 02:48.430
black box model.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.870
So there are no underlying parameters to learn.

02:51.940 --> 02:58.990
We just care about the relationships between the features and in this case the features are the possed

02:58.990 --> 03:00.250
stock prices.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.910
So it is working fine in the main but not during the crisis.

03:05.060 --> 03:12.430
A good algorithmic trading strategy is to combine both time theories analyze his methods and deep learning

03:12.430 --> 03:13.110
methods.

03:13.240 --> 03:18.500
By the way combining assets is the best way to go as far as I am concerned.

03:18.610 --> 03:24.960
For example back it's model or statistical arbitrage approaches are working extremely fine.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.270
So I'm a huge fan of market neutral strategies.

03:28.300 --> 03:35.620
If you search for LTE CMS so long term capital management you can take a look at the Sharpe ratio the

03:35.620 --> 03:39.270
Sharpe ratio has something to do with the risk and return.

03:39.430 --> 03:45.390
As you can see out his was quite successful they were making lots of lots of money.

03:45.400 --> 03:51.400
We are happy of combining assets such as Blackshaw is moral or statistical arbitrage.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.160
So that's why in my opinion it is the best way to go.

03:55.270 --> 04:02.410
Anyways in the coming lectures we are going to use deep learning and SDM architecture in order to predict

04:02.410 --> 04:03.600
stock prices.

04:03.730 --> 04:10.390
OK so in this chart we have time and we have the price of the store denoted by asty.

04:10.420 --> 04:13.680
So we just have to construct the training data set.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.960
For example we are going to use 40 features.

04:16.960 --> 04:24.640
So basically 40 stock prices in the past and price tomorrow is going to be the target variable.

04:24.640 --> 04:31.750
So the training means that we use an Alice D.M. architecture in order to detach the relationships between

04:31.750 --> 04:33.220
these 40 features.

04:33.310 --> 04:40.200
So between the prices in the past and as far as the production is concerned we have a 40 features.

04:40.270 --> 04:47.490
So basically the price is in the past and we would like to make a prediction as far as price to morrow

04:47.500 --> 04:48.510
is concern.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.170
So you may pose the question that how to construct the training data set.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.910
We just have to use a given window in this case we have three features.

04:57.910 --> 05:05.260
So three stock prices in the past and we have a single target voluble the stock price tomorrow.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.870
OK then we have to shift the window one step to the right.

05:08.900 --> 05:15.740
And again we had three features so Street stock prices in the past and the stock price tomorrow.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.870
Again we have to shift to the window and we have to use these street stock prices in the past.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.100
And a single target we're triable and so on.

05:25.100 --> 05:30.480
This is how we construct the training data set out of historical data.

05:30.620 --> 05:31.800
And why is it good.

05:31.850 --> 05:37.780
Because if we want to predict the stock price tomorrow we just have to use the previous stock prices.

05:37.850 --> 05:45.110
So these are stock prices in the past and we are able to predict the stock price tomorrow based on these

05:45.170 --> 05:47.740
long short term memory architecture.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.310
So this is what we are going to implement in the coming lectures.

05:51.470 --> 05:52.320
Thanks for watching.
