In this lecture they are going to talk about the different types of natural networks.

00:06.230 --> 00:12.110
So there are lots of lots of types of natural networks and there are several types of learning such

00:12.110 --> 00:19.500
as supervised learning and unsupervised learning as far as supervised learning is concerned.

00:19.550 --> 00:25.600
There is a given dataset on which we are going to train our own network.

00:25.610 --> 00:29.150
For example we have the x or logical relation.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.570
And that's why we have two features X and Y.

00:32.750 --> 00:41.750
And we have the labels basically the x or the values accordingly 0 0 and the label is 0 0 1.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.900
The label is 1.

00:42.920 --> 00:50.410
So for supervised learning we have a data set like this and we are going to train our natural network

00:50.630 --> 00:52.620
on a given dataset.

00:52.760 --> 00:59.630
So at the end of the training procedure our natural network will learn the relationship between the

00:59.630 --> 01:00.820
given features.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.300
In this case we have two features.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.720
X and Y.

01:04.790 --> 01:07.550
So this is called supervised learning.

01:07.550 --> 01:14.190
When we have given a data set as far as honest supervised learning is concerned we don't have a data

01:14.190 --> 01:15.520
set at all.

01:15.530 --> 01:21.710
The algorithm itself is going to make the classification or any other problem we dealt.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.500
Any data set.

01:23.510 --> 01:30.050
So as far as supervised learning is concerned there are artificial now and networks these networks are

01:30.050 --> 01:33.590
used for regression and classification.

01:33.590 --> 01:39.520
Then there are convolutional now where all the networks these networks are used for computer vision.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.290
So basically this is the most important.

01:42.290 --> 01:49.610
Now will the network as far as self-driving cars are concerned as far as pedestrian detection is concerned

01:49.610 --> 01:50.510
and so on.

01:50.540 --> 01:58.330
So convolutional now a rail network is one of the main reasons why deep learning is working quite fine.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.990
Then there are a recurrent now rule and that works.

02:00.990 --> 02:07.280
These networks can be used for time series analyzes I'm not sure whether you are familiar with the time

02:07.280 --> 02:16.320
series but basically you can analyze time series with several approaches such as auto correlation functions.

02:16.330 --> 02:23.030
There are lots of lots of models such as outmoded receive models moving ever reach modals and any other

02:23.030 --> 02:29.460
hetero's scholastic models in order to make some predictions on the stock market or only for X..

02:29.480 --> 02:32.290
So we drop off recurrent narrow networks.

02:32.390 --> 02:37.120
We are able to analyze time series we had artificial intelligence.

02:37.150 --> 02:43.970
OK as far as unsupervised learning this concern about some of the machines and outswing corridors and

02:43.970 --> 02:50.960
south organized maps are the most important algorithms these approaches are used for recommendation

02:50.960 --> 02:54.120
systems as well as for feature detection.

02:54.170 --> 03:00.650
So this is one of the most complex problems as far as artificial intelligence is concerned is how to

03:00.650 --> 03:03.510
select the features what are the features.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.170
Features are basically the columns in the data set.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.260
In this case for the X or logical relationship the features are x and y.

03:13.370 --> 03:18.840
But as far as time series are concerned there can be lots of lots of features.

03:18.890 --> 03:20.530
For example the stock price.

03:20.530 --> 03:25.370
Yesterday the stock price two days ago the stock price three days ago.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.100
These are all features.

03:27.140 --> 03:34.850
So somehow we have to sell at the most important and most relevant features in order to make good predictions.

03:34.850 --> 03:42.710
So South organizing maps can detect features and aboard some of the machines and our two encoders can

03:42.710 --> 03:45.450
be used for recommendation systems.

03:45.470 --> 03:50.180
So basically these are the most important approaches in artificial intelligence.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.000
Thanks for watching.
