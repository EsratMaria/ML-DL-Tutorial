00:01.540 --> 00:05.400
Let's talk a bit about maximum likelihood estimator.

00:05.530 --> 00:11.830
So we have been talking about in the previous lecture that we have to find a better parent leaders such

00:11.860 --> 00:17.820
as B to zero B to one in order to feed the logistic regression model.

00:17.830 --> 00:24.220
There are several ways to find these optimal parameters but usually the maximum likelihood method is

00:24.220 --> 00:24.730
used.

00:24.790 --> 00:31.450
OK so this is a method of estimating the parameters what parameters that beat up have in meters of a

00:31.450 --> 00:32.920
statistical model.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.260
So in this case the statistical model is logistic regression.

00:37.510 --> 00:45.130
A given observation by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations

00:45.220 --> 00:46.940
given the pairing meters.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.120
So we just need a data set.

00:49.240 --> 00:56.260
In our example we are going to use this credit data Dotsie as we as you can see there are lots of lots

00:56.260 --> 00:57.290
of samples.

00:57.370 --> 01:05.200
Concerning the income age loan loan to income ratio and whether they given the client has defaulted

01:05.230 --> 01:05.980
or not.

01:06.010 --> 01:11.880
So that target of triable is going to be the default rate is 0 and 1 avail us.

01:11.890 --> 01:15.220
So it is a binary classification problem.

01:15.340 --> 01:23.290
The output can be 0 or 1 0 if the client has defaulted and not able to pay back the loan.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.750
And one if the client is able to pay back the loan.

01:26.800 --> 01:32.830
OK so first we have to construct the so-called likelihood function this likelihood function or we'll

01:32.830 --> 01:36.370
have the BD paramita earth and the x values.

01:36.430 --> 01:44.530
What about the x values the x values are the balance on the credit card or age gender demographics loan

01:44.530 --> 01:46.430
to income ratio and so on.

01:46.540 --> 01:52.140
So these are the x values and of course we have to be the perimeter as we are after.

01:52.180 --> 01:58.480
Okay by the way we use the logarithm of the likelihood function which is called the log likelihood function

01:58.750 --> 02:05.440
because it is much more easier to optimize the logarithm of the likelihood function instead of dealing

02:05.440 --> 02:07.940
with the likelihood function exclusively.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.190
Okay so the aim is the same as we have seen for linear regression.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.620
We are after the optimal bead of values that maximize the likelihood function.

02:17.740 --> 02:24.820
So we are after the are the max as far as the Beatles are concerned for the likelihood function and

02:24.850 --> 02:27.710
we are after these optimal better parameters.

02:27.790 --> 02:35.770
Okay by the way we dont have to know about maximum likelihood method because it is going to do everything

02:35.770 --> 02:36.460
for us.

02:36.460 --> 02:42.940
We will see during the implementation that using logistic regression and fitting the model with maximum

02:42.940 --> 02:45.380
likelihood method is quite easy.

02:45.640 --> 02:51.460
So the likelihood function as far as logistic regression is concerned is something like this.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.190
We have to deal with the p values.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.050
What about these p values.

02:56.200 --> 03:01.900
We just have to use the sigmoid function as we have discussed in the previous lecture one divided by

03:01.900 --> 03:06.630
one plus each to the power of minus X transpose time in B.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.520
Basically we are able to express this formula.

03:09.520 --> 03:18.550
So between 0 plus a B to 1 times X1 applause B two times 2 up to beat and times X and we are able to

03:18.550 --> 03:23.860
use this formula instead x y prime time is the beat of values.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.720
OK but it is the same.

03:25.750 --> 03:32.740
So this estimate is usually obtained by using the iterative algorithm Muto Rosseau math.

03:32.860 --> 03:39.640
We the map of this numerical method we are able to find the extremum of a given function.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.000
In this case we would like to maximize the likelihood function.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.170
Ok so this is what's happening under the hood.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.650
But Skateland is going to do everything for us.

03:50.650 --> 03:51.610
Thanks for watching.
