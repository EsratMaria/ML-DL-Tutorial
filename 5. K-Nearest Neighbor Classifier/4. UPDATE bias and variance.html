<p>Sorry I made a mistake concerning bias and variance. So just to summarize again:</p><p>1.) when k is small: it is called overfitting because it models the noise and becomes high variance and less biased model</p><p>2.) when k is high: it is called underfitting. So variance is small but on the other hand there is a high bias.</p>
